The desire of Enterprises to embed their mobile apps' development into their business cycle increases the need to have a specialized software development process. Although many agile methods have been introduced over the last decade, none of methods has focused on reducing usability errors.

This paper presents the design, implementation, wide deployment, and evaluation of the low cost, physical exercise, and gaming (exergaming) FitForAll (FFA) platform system usability, user adherence to exercise, and efficacy are explored. The design of FFA is tailored to elderly populations, distilling literature guidelines and recommendations. The FFA architecture introduces standard physical exercise protocols in exergaming software engineering, as well as, standard physical assessment tests for augmented adaptability through adjustable exercise intensity. This opens up the way to next generation exergaming software, which may be more automatically/smartly adaptive. 116 elderly users piloted FFA five times/week, during an eight-week controlled intervention. Usability evaluation was formally conducted (SUS, SUMI questionnaires). Control group consisted of a size-matched elderly group following cognitive training. Efficacy was assessed objectively through the senior fitness (Fullerton) test, and subjectively, through WHOQoL-BREF comparisons of pre-postintervention between groups. Adherence to schedule was measured by attendance logs. The global SUMI score was 68.33±5.85%, while SUS was 77.7. Good usability perception is reflected in relatively high adherence of 82% for a daily two months pilot schedule. Compared to control group, elderly using FFA improved significantly strength, flexibility, endurance, and balance while presenting a significant trend in quality of life improvements. This is the first elderly focused exergaming platform intensively evaluated with more than 100 participants.

Failure of such systems (such as those found in medical settings or transportation) can lead to serious harm or even fatalities. Model-based development of interactive systems provides a number of benefits which can support correctness of the interface, the interaction and the functional logic of the system. Many different approaches have been proposed which target the models at different aspects of the development process (for example task analysis, interface layouts, functional behaviours etc.) and which can be used in different ways (verification of correctness, usability, testing). Typically these rely on multiple models at differing levels of abstraction. There are challenges in ensuring consistency between the models, and more importantly in ensuring that the final implementation correctly satisfies all of the models. In this paper we propose a method of deriving pre-and post-conditions for both interactive and functional elements of the system from formal models. These are used to generate code contracts within a code framework to support programmers who are implementing the system described in such models. We describe both the process for this and present an initial examination of the applicability of the approach based on a proof-of-concept user study. This small study was intended to examine whether we could correctly derive the code contracts in an automated fashion and whether or not they were usable (and beneficial) for programmers working on a pre-defined task. This initial investigation suggested that such an approach can aid programmers in correctly implementing a specification and that the general approach outlined in the paper is worth developing further.","2377-5408","978-1-7281-1241-1","10.1109/ASWEC.2018.00010","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ezproxybib.pucp.edu.pe/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8587281","Model driven development;Assertions;Code contracts;Interactive systems","Task analysis;Object oriented modeling;Interactive systems;Contracts;Software;User interfaces;Semantics","formal specification;formal verification;interactive systems;object-oriented programming;program compilers;safety-critical software;software engineering;task analysis","model-driven code contracts;safety-critical interactive systems;software engineering techniques;task analysis;programmers aid;formal models;interface layouts;functional logic;model-based development","","","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our approach avoids weaknesses of traditional RBAC approaches and provides a practically usable security model for multi-agent systems (MAS). A unified role interaction model framework has been put forward that incorporates not only functional requirements but also security constraints in MAS. A security policy rule scheme has been used to express security requirements in relation to affective roles. The major contribution of the work is that little redevelopment effort will be required when security is to be engineered into the overall MAS architecture, hence minimising the impact of the security requirements changes to the MAS architecture.

With every lift they put themselves at risk of injury. Many still-frame modeling systems exist that can assess the different stresses and strains on the laborers body given his or her position. These models are only usable by experts, and do not allow for real-time alerts. In 1995, companies in the United States lost $50 billion due to injured employee absences and compensation settlements. Companies are not only eager to reduce their overhead costs, but also aim to better society by offering more robust worker safety practices. The focus of this project was to design a system that can be used in a training environment. Our system is used to teach employees if their current lifting and carrying methods can be detrimental to their health. Our system is designed to be used for longstanding employees as well as new hires. This project's primary requirement was to implement a motion sensing device to aid in the analysis of ergonomics in an industrial environment. To do this we proposed to make use of Microsoft Kinect© sensors. The Kinect© is able to provide skeletal tracking at 30 frames/second for two individuals in the field of view. To develop the system we selected the Microsoft software development kit (SDK) from a large variety of alternative professional and open source SDKs because of a variety of desirable features. A static ergonomic model was integrated with the Kinect© software. Multiple other software packages were assessed for compatibility with the Kinect© in an effort to enhance the Kinects'O ability to recognize objects and humans. After development was complete the system was tested by analyzing our system's output using different skeletal lift positions to compare to the real results. Our system provides real-time ergonomic analysis of lifts performed by humans. This system lacks the ability to recognize specific individuals and objects necessary to customize the system to adequately evaluate a lift, and has not been tested in a factory environment. In the future we hope to implement a dynamic ergonomic model so that it can recognize whole movements or gestures which lead to injury, rather than recognizing a single position. Our system successfully outputs a number for the recommended weight limit as well as other methods to measure the strain on a worker's skeleton. In a training environment the system will help individuals correct the problems with their lifting motions.","","978-1-4673-1286-8","10.1109/SIEDS.2012.6215130","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ezproxybib.pucp.edu.pe/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6215130","","Ergonomics;Training;Joints;Accuracy;Real time systems;Sensors;Occupational safety","ergonomics;interactive devices;occupational health;occupational safety;personnel;production engineering computing;production facilities;software packages","realtime ergonomic monitoring system;Microsoft Kinect;factories;still-frame modeling system;laborer stress;laborer strain;United States;injured employee absence;compensation settlement;overhead cost reduction;worker safety practice;lifting method;carrying method;longstanding employee;new hire employee;motion sensing device;Microsoft software development kit;static ergonomic model;software package","","33","","4","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

That is, they are used by millions (or billions) of users across the world. Users express their daily experience of applications as reviews on those stores. This experience may include reporting bugs, demanding new features, posting feedback with regards to performance, reporting security issues, demanding user interface enhancements, and other needs. Interestingly, reviews could contain valuable information for the interest of application vendors and developers. However, the volume of such data is as huge, that is, traditional searching algorithms may not be efficient in extracting such useful information. Machine learning and data mining techniques are one of the popularly used algorithms to efficiently extracting significant information for Software Requirement Engineering; a key phase in the Software Engineering Life Cycle. In this paper, we experience machine learning algorithms and natural language processing techniques to classify a set of reviews about healthcare-domain applications into multiple types of categories such as bug reports, new feature requests, application performance, and user interface. For this purpose, we could extract more than 7500 reviews of ten different health-related mobile applications. More importantly, those reviews were annotated manually by software experts. In our experiments, we use the Weka tool employing different machine learning algorithms. We will also show what algorithms and features will perform better; in terms of accuracy using different evaluation metrics, when classifying reviews about mobile apps into various classes; bugs, new features, sentimental, general bug, usability, security, and performance. Moreover, the conducted experiments show that the overall performance improves when we use the data subset with highly confident labeling; when two experts agree on the same class. For the imbalanced-data problem, this research will show the effect of applying resampling techniques on improving classification accuracy as well.","","978-1-7281-2946-4","10.1109/SNAMS.2019.8931820","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ezproxybib.pucp.edu.pe/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8931820","Requirements Engineering;User's Reviews;Data Annotation;Supervised Machine Learning;Text Classification","","data mining;formal specification;health care;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;natural language processing;pattern classification;software maintenance;user interfaces","automatic classification;apps reviews;healthcare applications;security issues;user interface enhancements;application vendors;popularly used algorithms;Software Requirement Engineering;Software Engineering Life Cycle;experience machine learning algorithms;healthcare-domain applications;bug reports;feature requests;application performance;software experts;review classification;sentimental bug;general bug;health-related mobile applications","","","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Measuring ontologies in general and inter-organizational ontologies in special is necessary to evaluate ontologies during cooperative development and evolution processes. A software metric is a standard of measuring the degree to which a software system and process possess some property. Metrics help to estimate the progress, quality, and health of a software and its development process. The availability of robust metrics in the early phases of the software development allows the better management of the later steps and a more efficient quality assessment when preventive or corrective actions can easily enhance quality. In this paper, we propose a set of cooperative Scrum based software metrics and architectural metrics that can be applied to cooperative ontology development and evolution process using Scrum framework. These metrics help improve cooperative teams' performance and improve the quality of development and evolution process of inter-organizational ontologies. Furthermore, most of these metrics can be applied easily to any daily ontology activities to ensure ontology reliability, maintainability, and usability.","","978-1-5386-2150-9","10.1109/ICKEA.2017.8169903","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ezproxybib.pucp.edu.pe/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8169903","ontology quality;software metrics;team performance;architectural metric","Ontologies;Software;Tools;Software metrics;Collaboration","ontologies (artificial intelligence);semantic Web;software metrics;software prototyping","evolution process;inter-organizational ontologies;daily ontology activities;software metric;measuring ontologies;software system;development process;robust metrics;software development;efficient quality assessment;architectural metrics;cooperative teams;ontology analysis;cooperative scrum;cooperative ontology development","","","","52","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a result, new pilot programs and clinical trials continue to be launched to establish clinical evidence. However, the continual need for software changes between iterations of the trial creates a lengthy time loop between clinical researchers requesting a change and software developers implementing the requested change. We propose a new methodology for performing clinical trials, called ScaleMed. The ScaleMed methodology involves decoupling low-level app functionality from high-level trial-related operational parameters, a common software development practice. By utilizing a centralized website that allows clinical researchers to rapidly update these trial parameters, iterative clinical trials have the potential to move at a much faster rate than in current practice. We demonstrate an example of the ScaleMed methodology applied to an ongoing mental health trial (codenamed Lucy). In addition, we conducted a separate trial on the usability of the ScaleMed-enabled Lucy platform and found a predominantly positive response from the potential clinical users. In our limited trials, we showed that the time to make changes to app parameters was cut from weeks to less than a minute.","","978-1-4673-8325-7","10.1109/HealthCom.2015.7454487","","https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ezproxybib.pucp.edu.pe/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7454487","","Clinical trials;Software;Servers;Smart phones;Planning;Iterative methods","health care;iterative methods;patient monitoring;smart phones;telemedicine","iterative mHealth clinical trials;mHealth;smartphones;healthcare monitoring;healthcare delivery;clinical evidence;clinical researchers;software developers;low-level app functionality;high-level trial-related operational parameters;software development practice;centralized website;mental health trial;ScaleMed-enabled Lucy platform;potential clinical users","","2","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
