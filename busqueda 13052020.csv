Methods: Quantitative study of methodological development. For software development, the following steps were followed: definition of objectives; determination of the target audience; choice of pedagogical and theoretical reference for content; content selection and structuring; software development and evaluation by experts (five nurses and four physicians). All responded to an instrument that included four domains: pedagogical; content; functionality; system presentation and usability. The evaluation criteria were arranged on a Likert-type scale. The percentage of agreement and Content Validity Index were used for the quantitative analysis of the degree of agreement, considering a Content Validity Index cutoff point equal to 0.80. Results: The overall agreement index, calculated by the arithmetic mean of the Contents Validity Index of the evaluated domains, was 0.96, with scores ranging from 0.90 to 1.00. The average percentage of agreement of the experts per domain was 92.86%, with lower agreement in the content (80.95%), presentation, and usability (90.48%) domains. 100% of percentage of agreement was observed in the pedagogical and functionality domains among the evaluated specialists. Conclusion: The percentage of agreement, Content Validity Index and overall agreement index of the Child Health Handbook educational software in the context of primary care disclosed the software adequacy as an educational resource for continuing education of primary care nurses and physicians. Considering the assessed dimensions, it can also be used by other health professionals and undergraduate students. © 2020","Child health; Educational technology; Primary health care; Professional qualification; Validation of computer software","arithmetic; article; child health; content validity; continuing education; doctor nurse relation; educational technology; female; human; human experiment; Likert scale; male; primary health care; quantitative analysis; software; theoretical study; undergraduate student",Article,"Article in Press",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083102773

With this in mind, immersive virtual reality (VR) games are being developed to promote physical activity, and are generally evaluated through user studies. However, building such applications is time consuming and expensive. This paper introduces VR-Rides, an object-oriented application framework focused on the development of experiment-oriented VR exergames. Following the modular programming pattern, this framework facilitates the integration of different hardware (such as VR devices, sensors, and physical activity devices) within immersive VR experiences that overlay game narratives on Google Street View panoramas. Combining software engineering and interaction patterns, modules of VR-Rides can be easily added and managed in the Unity game engine. We evaluate the code efficiency and development effort across our VR exergames developed using VR-Rides. The reliability, maintainability, and usability of our framework are also demonstrated via code metrics analysis and user studies. The results show that investing in a systematic approach to reusing code and design can be a worthwhile effort for researchers beyond software engineering. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","code reuse; exergame; immersive virtual reality; object-oriented application framework; reusable component; Unity","Computer software reusability; Reliability analysis; Virtual reality; Code reuse; exergame; Immersive virtual reality; Object oriented application; Reusable components; Unity; Object oriented programming",Article,"Article in Press",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85080090934

The primary objective of this study is to examine healthcare-related websites in nine European countries in order to evaluate the status of their accessibility. Such a detailed statistical comparison has not yet been made in Europe, especially as the present study offers a dual measurement system combining both the application of automated testing software and statistical analysis of user feedback. The study compares 48 websites from Eastern Europe with 51 sites from Western and Northern Europe. The research phase was performed in three steps: firstly by using AChecker, secondly by Nibbler and subsequently followed by user feedback questionnaires evaluated by a group of experts. The overall goal of this study is to determine the most common accessibility problems and to draw site owners’ attention to shortcomings so that they can improve the quality of service of their healthcare-related sites in the future. The investigated European websites are grouped into Eastern and Western–Northern countries. We compared our results from different perspectives and ascertained that no significant differences can be established between the two groups predicated on their respective economic situations. Equally, no correlations were observed while comparing the sizes of web pages in Kbytes, the number of barriers and their Nibbler accessibility scores. Furthermore, there appears to be no correlation between the results of the software tests and the percentage of the elderly population in the respective country. © 2019, The Author(s).","Computer science; Software engineering; Testing tools; Usability testing; WCAG 2.0; Web design",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85068847464

That is, they are used by millions (or billions) of users across the world. Users express their daily experience of applications as reviews on those stores. This experience may include reporting bugs, demanding new features, posting feedback with regards to performance, reporting security issues, demanding user interface enhancements, and other needs. Interestingly, reviews could contain valuable information for the interest of application vendors and developers. However, the volume of such data is as huge, that is, traditional searching algorithms may not be efficient in extracting such useful information. Machine learning and data mining techniques are one of the popularly used algorithms to efficiently extracting significant information for Software Requirement Engineering; a key phase in the Software Engineering Life Cycle. In this paper, we experience machine learning algorithms and natural language processing techniques to classify a set of reviews about healthcare-domain applications into multiple types of categories such as bug reports, new feature requests, application performance, and user interface. For this purpose, we could extract more than 7500 reviews of ten different health-related mobile applications. More importantly, those reviews were annotated manually by software experts. In our experiments, we use the Weka tool employing different machine learning algorithms. We will also show what algorithms and features will perform better; in terms of accuracy using different evaluation metrics, when classifying reviews about mobile apps into various classes; bugs, new features, sentimental, general bug, usability, security, and performance. Moreover, the conducted experiments show that the overall performance improves when we use the data subset with highly confident labeling; when two experts agree on the same class. For the imbalanced-data problem, this research will show the effect of applying resampling techniques on improving classification accuracy as well. © 2019 IEEE.","Data Annotation; Requirements Engineering; Supervised Machine Learning; Text Classification; User's Reviews","Classification (of information); Data mining; Engineering education; Health care; Life cycle; Machine learning; Mobile computing; Natural language processing systems; Network security; Requirements engineering; Software engineering; Supervised learning; Text processing; User interfaces; Automatic classification; Classification accuracy; Data annotation; Imbalanced data problems; NAtural language processing; Software engineering life-cycle; Supervised machine learning; Text classification; Learning algorithms",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85077823538

Designing an app to support nurses' work at the bedside is a challenging task, given the complexity of the care process. Objective: This study aimed to present the design, development, and testing of a smartphone app for nurses guided by an adapted software development life cycle model that takes into consideration the complexity and constraints of a health care setting. Methods: The model drives us through an iterative development process intersected by 3 stages of formative evaluation of growing ecological validity. Results: The initial requirements identification stage included 11 participants who helped us select the most important functionalities to integrate into the tool. Starting with a usability evaluation allowed for the identification of design issues that could have caused misuse. Then, making on-site evaluations under the supervision of an investigator helped to understand the adequacy of the tool with limited risks. Finally, the on-site evaluation allowed us to validate the acceptance of the app by caregivers. Conclusions: The interpretation of the collected evaluation confirms the necessary involvement of end users early in the process to help address the heterogeneity of the nursing workflow processes in the different wards. We also highlight the delicate balance between high-security measures to protect access to patient data and maintaining ease of access for efficiency and usability. Although a close collaboration with clinicians throughout the entire project facilitated the development of a tailored solution, it was also important to involve all stakeholders, in particular, the information technology (IT) security officers. © 2019 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

Various data representations can describe segmentation results, such as labelmap volumes or surface models. Conversions between them are often required, which typically include complex data processing steps. We identified four challenges related to managing multiple representations: conversion method selection, data provenance, data consistency, and coherence of in-memory objects. Methods: A complex data container preserves identity and provenance of the contained representations and ensures data coherence. Conversions are executed automatically on-demand. A graph containing the implemented conversion algorithms determines each execution, ensuring consistency between various representations. The design and implementation of a software library are proposed, in order to provide a readily usable software tool to manage segmentation data in multiple data representations. A low-level core library called PolySeg implemented in the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) manages the data objects and conversions. It is used by a high-level application layer, which has been implemented in the medical image visualization and analysis platform 3D Slicer. The application layer provides advanced visualization, transformation, interoperability, and other functions. Results: The core conversion algorithms comprising the graph were validated. Several applications were implemented based on the library, demonstrating advantages in terms of usability and ease of software development in each case. The Segment Editor application provides fast, comprehensive, and easy-to-use manual and semi-automatic segmentation workflows. Clinical applications for gel dosimetry, external beam planning, and MRI-ultrasound image fusion in brachytherapy were rapidly prototyped resulting robust applications that are already in use in clinical research. The conversion algorithms were found to be accurate and reliable using these applications. Conclusions: A generic software library has been designed and developed for automatic management of multiple data formats in segmentation tasks. It enhances both user and developer experience, enabling fast and convenient manual workflows and quicker and more robust software prototyping. The software's BSD-style open-source license allows complete freedom of use of the library. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","3D Slicer; DICOM; Open-source; Segmentation; Software library; Voxelization","Application programs; Clinical research; Data handling; Data visualization; Image fusion; Image segmentation; Magnetic resonance imaging; Medical computing; Medical image processing; Open source software; Open systems; Software design; Three dimensional computer graphics; Ubiquitous computing; Visualization; 3-D slicer; DICOM; Open sources; Software libraries; Voxelization; Software prototyping; algorithm; Article; brachytherapy; clinical research; comparative study; computer analysis; data analysis software; diagnostic imaging; digital imaging and communications in medicine; dosimetry; external beam radiotherapy; human; image analysis; image segmentation; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; prostate biopsy; prostate cancer; stereolithography; tumor biopsy; computer assisted diagnosis; computer graphics; diagnostic imaging; image processing; procedures; software; three dimensional imaging; Algorithms; Computer Graphics; Diagnostic Imaging; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Software",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85061893372

The purpose of this study was to perform a usability evaluation of a telerehabilitation platform. To improve the level of usability, the researchers developed and proposed an iterative process. The platform uses a digital representation of the patient which duplicates the therapeutic exercise being executed by the patient; this is detected by a Kinect camera and sensors in real time. This study used inspection methods to perform a usability evaluation of an exploratory prototype of a telerehabilitation platform. In addition, a cognitive workload assessment was performed to complement the usability evaluation. Users were involved through all the stages of the iterative refinement process. Usability issues were progressively reduced from the first iteration to the fourth iteration according to improvements which were developed and applied by the experts. Usability issues originally cataloged as catastrophic were reduced to zero, major usability problems were reduced to ten (2.75%) and minor usability problems were decreased to 141 (38.74%). This study also intends to serve as a guide to improve the usability of e-Health systems in alignment with the software development cycle. © 2019 by the authors.","Exploratory prototyping; Heuristic evaluation; Software product quality; Telemedicine; Telerehabilitation; Usability evaluation; User interface",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85061048407

While several resources are available for introducing scientists to the basics of programming, researchers have been left with little guidance on approaches needed to advance to the next level for the development of robust, large-scale data analysis tools that are amenable to integration into workflow management systems, tools, and frameworks. The integration into such workflow systems necessitates additional requirements on computational tools, such as adherence to standard conventions for robustness, data input, output, logging, and flow control. Here we provide a set of 10 guidelines to steer the creation of command-line computational tools that are usable, reliable, extensible, and in line with standards of modern coding practices. © The Author(s) 2019.

Research was done with students of the health courses, which helped to prove the direct effect in the improvement of cognitive functions such as memory, attention, perception, among others. The acquired advantages of technology, when well used are unimaginable, especially when used for education. The barriers encountered by this tool to realize its real application were perceptible, but these were worked on and perfected to find a balance between education and fun. We can infer that this tool, when properly applied, is able to attract and perpetuate information in students in any educational field. In this context, an educational game was developed that serves as a support to the learning process of the students of nursing courses. The goal of this research was to analyze the usability and satisfaction of the educational game “Treat Well!” which teaches the treatment of a simple wound with nursing students. For the development of the project, the methodology used was based on software engineering practices, User Centered Design and Usability and Satisfaction Analysis. The study was also based on a qualitative and quantitative approach with exploratory character and also statistical. The qualitative variable used to capture the perception of users in the study was made in an empirical way of observing the search for relevant and convenient data obtained through experience observed. The quantitative variables used to analyze usability were the effectiveness, time of use and user perception through the Attrakdiff questionnaire. The usability test was performed with high fidelity game prototype with 10 volunteers in a college in Recife Brazil. From the results generated we can understand that improvements can be made to a greater identification and interaction of the user with the proposed game. © 2019, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","Human factors; Usability; User experience","Curricula; Engineering education; Human computer interaction; Human engineering; Nursing; Serious games; Software engineering; Teaching; Technology transfer; Usability engineering; Cognitive functions; Higher education institutions; Production process; Qualitative and quantitative approaches; Quantitative variables; Software engineering practices; Usability; User experience; Students",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049527333

Despite the several therapeutic and economic advantages of this new paradigm, it is important to follow certain guidelines, in order to build a safe, useful, scalable, and ergonomic tool. This work proposes to address all these points, through the case study of a physical tele-rehabilitation platform for patients after hip replacement surgery. The scalability and versatility of the system is handled by the implementation of a modular architecture. The safeness and effectiveness of the tool is ensured by an artificial intelligence module that assesses the quality of the movements performed by the user. The usability of the application is evaluated by a cognitive walkthrough method. Results show that the system (i) is able to properly assess the correctness of the human’s motion through two possible methods (Dynamic Time Warping and Hidden Markov Model), and (ii) provides a good user experience. The discussion addresses (i) the advantages and disadvantages of the main approaches for a gesture recognition of therapeutic movements, and (ii) critical aspects to provide the patient with the best usability of a tele-rehabilitation platform. © 2019 by the authors.

Designing an app to support nurses’ work at the bedside is a challenging task, given the complexity of the care process. Objective: This study aimed to present the design, development, and testing of a smartphone app for nurses guided by an adapted software development life cycle model that takes into consideration the complexity and constraints of a health care setting. Methods: The model drives us through an iterative development process intersected by 3 stages of formative evaluation of growing ecological validity. Results: The initial requirements identification stage included 11 participants who helped us select the most important functionalities to integrate into the tool. Starting with a usability evaluation allowed for the identification of design issues that could have caused misuse. Then, making on-site evaluations under the supervision of an investigator helped to understand the adequacy of the tool with limited risks. Finally, the on-site evaluation allowed us to validate the acceptance of the app by caregivers. Conclusions: The interpretation of the collected evaluation confirms the necessary involvement of end users early in the process to help address the heterogeneity of the nursing workflow processes in the different wards. We also highlight the delicate balance between high-security measures to protect access to patient data and maintaining ease of access for efficiency and usability. Although a close collaboration with clinicians throughout the entire project facilitated the development of a tailored solution, it was also important to involve all stakeholders, in particular, the information technology (IT) security officers. © Frederic Ehrler, Christian Lovis, Katherine Blondon.","Hospital information systems; MHealth; Nursing",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85066499955

OCD can have an enormous impact on the lives of those with the disorder, with some studies suggesting suicidal ideation is present in over 50% of individuals with OCD, and other data showing a significant number of individuals attempt suicide. It is therefore important that individuals with OCD receive the best possible treatment. A greater understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders among professionals and future clinicians can lead to improved treatment. However, data suggests that many students and clinicians experience “neurophobia”, a lack of knowledge or confidence in cases involving the nervous system. In addition, research suggests that the relationship many students have with neurological conditions deteriorates over time, and can persist into practice. If individuals living with conditions such as OCD are to receive the best possible treatment, it is crucial that those administering care are equipped with a thorough understanding of such disorders. While research has shown that the use of interactive 3D models can improve anatomy education and more specifically neurology education, the efficacy of using of such models to engage with neuropsychiatric conditions, specifically OCD, has not been assessed. This study seeks to address this gap. In this study an interactive application for Android devices was designed using standardised software engineering methods in order to improve neuropsychiatry literacy by empowering self-pace learning through interactive 3D visualisations and animations of the neural circuitry involved in OCD. A pilot test and a usability assessment were conducted among five postgraduate life science students. Findings relating to user experience were promising, and pre-test vs. post-test evaluation suggested encouraging outcomes regarding the effectiveness of the application in improving the knowledge and understanding of OCD. In short, this study suggests that interactive 3D visualisations can improve neuropsychiatry education. For this reason, more efforts should be made to construct similar applications in order to ensure patients always receive the best possible care.

The study was divided into two phases: image acquisition and software development. The first phase was to obtain plain radiographic images and computed tomographic (CT) scans of an anthropomorphic phantom of head and neck. In addition, plain radiographic images of an anthropomorphic phantom of the chest were obtained. The second phase was the development of the anatomy software as an ImageJ macro. The software was developed through the insertion of the radiologic anatomy landmarks into the images that were obtained and application of multiple choice questions. The software was then tested for usability by getting the professors to answer the multiple choice questions. The software presented radiologic anatomy from 1) Head projections: Waters view, Towne view, Caldwell view, Lateral view, Submentovertex, PA view; 2) Thoracic Spine projections: AP and Lateral View and 3) Chest: PA view, Lateral and Oblique. Tomographic imaging presented one hundred radiologic landmarks of head. In total, there were 354 questions. A final report containing the score of correct answers, as well as the user ID, Date and Time of the test were showed. The test were available in three languages (Spanish, English and Portuguese). A user-friendly and inexpensive software was developed and presented.

Yet, there has been little research so far applying mHealth technologies in the context of delivering stroke care in resource-limited rural regions. Objective: This study aimed to introduce the design and development of an mHealth system targeting primary health care providers and to ascertain its feasibility in supporting the delivery of a System-Integrated techNology-Enabled Model of cAre (SINEMA) service for strengthening secondary prevention of stroke in rural China. Methods: The SINEMA mHealth system was designed by a multidisciplinary team comprising public health researchers, neurologists, and information and communication technology experts. The iterative co-design and development of the mHealth system involved the following 5 steps: (1) assessing the needs of relevant end users through in-depth interviews of stakeholders, (2) designing the functional modules and evidence-based care content, (3) designing and building the system and user interface, (4) improving and enhancing the system through a 3-month pilot test in 4 villages, and (5) finalizing the system and deploying it in field trial, and finally, evaluating its feasibility through a survey of the dominant user group. Results: From the in-depth interviews of 49 relevant stakeholders, we found that village doctors had limited capacity in caring for village-dwelling stroke patients in rural areas. Primary health care workers demonstrated real needs in receiving appropriate training and support from the mHealth system as well as great interests in using the mHealth technologies and tools. Using these findings, we designed a multifaceted mHealth system with 7 functional modules by following the iterative user-centered design and software development approach. The mHealth system, aimed at 3 different types of users (village doctors, town physicians, and county managers), was developed and utilized in a cluster-randomized controlled trial by 25 village doctors in a resource-limited county in rural China to manage 637 stroke patients between July 2017 and July 2018. In the end, a survey on the usability and functions of the mHealth system among village doctors (the dominant group of users, response rate=96%, 24/25) revealed that most of them were satisfied with the essential functions provided (71%) and were keen to continue using it (92%) after the study. Conclusions: The mHealth system was feasible for assisting primary health care providers in rural China in delivering the SINEMA service on the secondary prevention of stroke. Further research and initiatives in scaling up the SINEMA approach and this mHealth system to other resource-limited regions in China and beyond will likely enhance the quality and accessibility of essential secondary prevention among stroke patients. © Na Wu, Enying Gong, Bo Wang, Wanbing Gu, Nan Ding, Zhuoran Zhang, Mengyao Chen, Lijing L Yan, Brian Oldenburg, Li-Qun Xu.","China; Mobile application; Rural health services; Secondary prevention; Software design; Stroke",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85074265502

Combining all these elements together, the risk associated to the flight can raise significantly, eventually resulting in a situation in which the flight should be cancelled, unless some mitigation of the risk factors are applied. The aim is the understanding of the expectable human abilities and limitations, in correlation with the aircraft status and all the external elements related to the flight. Following the guidance contained in Ref.1, this knowledge has being applied in the definition of a standardize approach for the design of the risk assessment procedures and software requirements. For the safety of the flight, it is essential that the pilot is able to discern in advance between a low and a high risk flight. With a Flight Risk Analysis Tool (FRAT) the pilot can proactively identify the hazard with a visual representation of the risk, applying an evaluation process and risk mitigation strategies, as described in Ref. 2. Moreover to better support this analysis the tool shall be enough complex to consider all aspects, but at the same time, easy to use and simply accessible (i.e. usable by an application installed on the portable device). SkyFlight has been developed to support the flight planning activities for the rotorcraft mission, being the optimal off-aircraft mean to carry out the evaluation of the flight, ensuring a thorough Safety Assessment. Pilots have SkyFlight application installed on their portable devices to access the service. As presented in Ref.3, SkyFlight gives to the Pilot a deep understanding of the current situation and the involved dynamics, to anticipate changes and future developments, and to clearly understand the consequences related to the flight. The features are designed to positively increase the Pilot Situational Awareness and reduce mission risks. The Safety is spread within all functionalities, starting from simple and common concepts, to a finer level with a deep performance calculations and what-if analysis. To further increase the safety, the latest developed functionality is the Flight Risk Assessment, which has been developed following the EASA and FAA standards, discussed in Ref. 4 and 5, and embedding the EHEST pre-departure Risk Assessment Checklist, provided in Ref. 5. The predefined set of checklist is available to support different types of flight (Training, HEMS, passenger, etc.) and each list is based on the PAVE (Pilot, Aircraft, Environment, External pressure) areas. In addition to the pre-departure Checklists, also In-flight and Post-flight Checklists have been shaped, following the approach discussed in Ref. 6. Through SkyFlight the pilot is able to fill the Risk Assessment Checklist, inserting mitigations where applicable and view the total score. The filled checklist can be saved and shared. It is also possible to export them in a pdf format and to send automatically via email to one or more email addresses. In addition to this, which reflects the state of the art for FRAT, some other peculiar features have been designed. Indeed, to better support the different rotorcraft missions and to meet the process of each operator, the Risk Assessment Checklists will be completely customized by the company safety manager. The functionalities have then being further enhanced with software developments to add value to the tool with both small and big features. For example, the order of the multiple choice answers changes every time the pilot access to the checklist, to guide her/him to read carefully the answers before the selection. More complex functionalities have been inserted to connect the flight planned with SkyFlight to the hazard evaluation, showing the weather data and all the notifications associated to the flight (NOTAMs, Warning/restrictive Airspaces infringements …). AW SkyFlight application can be installed on personal portable devices and the Flight Risk Assessment functionality can be used for free, to let every pilot from the general aviation to access to the safety enhancements above described. The FRAT capabilities, usability and utility have been then tested with the Leonardo Helicopters Division pilots as well as a set of specific customers pilots as representatives of the different types of operations (in the Executive and Private transport, Medical and Rescue services, Offshore operations, Security services and Utility).

Failure of such systems (such as those found in medical settings or transportation) can lead to serious harm or even fatalities. Model-based development of interactive systems provides a number of benefits which can support correctness of the interface, the interaction and the functional logic of the system. Many different approaches have been proposed which target the models at different aspects of the development process (for example task analysis, interface layouts, functional behaviours etc.) and which can be used in different ways (verification of correctness, usability, testing). Typically these rely on multiple models at differing levels of abstraction. There are challenges in ensuring consistency between the models, and more importantly in ensuring that the final implementation correctly satisfies all of the models. In this paper we propose a method of deriving pre-and post-conditions for both interactive and functional elements of the system from formal models. These are used to generate code contracts within a code framework to support programmers who are implementing the system described in such models. We describe both the process for this and present an initial examination of the applicability of the approach based on a proof-of-concept user study. This small study was intended to examine whether we could correctly derive the code contracts in an automated fashion and whether or not they were usable (and beneficial) for programmers working on a pre-defined task. This initial investigation suggested that such an approach can aid programmers in correctly implementing a specification and that the general approach outlined in the paper is worth developing further. © 2018 IEEE.","Assertions; Code contracts; Interactive systems; Model driven development","Codes (symbols); Job analysis; Safety engineering; Assertions; Design and Development; Functional elements; Interactive system; Levels of abstraction; Model based development; Model driven development; Pre and post conditions; Software engineering",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85061054394

However, the last two decades has seen the ubiquitous use of insecticides, predominantly pyrethroids, causing widespread insecticide resistance and compromising the effectiveness of vector control. Considerable efforts to develop new active ingredients and interventions are underway. However, it is essential to deploy strategies to mitigate the impact of insecticide resistance now, both to maintain the efficacy of currently available tools as well as to ensure the sustainability of new tools as they come to market. Although the World Health Organization disseminated best practice guidelines for insecticide resistance management (IRM), Rollback Malaria's Vector Control Working Group identified the lack of practical knowledge of IRM as the primary gap in the translation of evidence into policy. ResistanceSim is a capacity strengthening tool designed to address this gap. The development process involved frequent stakeholder consultation, including two separate workshops. These workshops defined the learning objectives, target audience, and the role of mathematical models in the game. Software development phases were interspersed with frequent user testing, resulting in an iterative design process. User feedback was evaluated via questionnaires with Likert-scale and open-ended questions. The game was regularly evaluated by subject-area experts through meetings of an external advisory panel. Through these processes, a series of learning domains were identified and a set of specific learning objectives for each domain were defined to be communicated to vector control programme personnel. A simple ""game model"" was proposed that produces realistic outputs based on player strategy and also runs in real-time. Early testing sessions revealed numerous usability issues that prevented adequate player engagement. After extensive revisions, later testing sessions indicated that the tool would be a valuable addition to IRM training. © 2018 The Author(s).","Capacity building; Insecticide resistance; Insecticide resistance management; Serious games; Training; Vector control","Article; attitude to health; clinical effectiveness; consultation; evidence based medicine; health care policy; health program; insecticide resistance; Likert scale; mathematical model; practice guideline; program acceptability; questionnaire; simulation; software; vector control; World Health Organization; animal; Anopheles; drug effect; game; human; malaria; mosquito control; mosquito vector; procedures; insecticide; Animals; Anopheles; Game Theory; Games, Experimental; Humans; Insecticide Resistance; Insecticides; Malaria; Mosquito Control; Mosquito Vectors",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85056537779

In Mexico, it is estimated that by 2025, there will be 212 thousand CKD cases. Among the renal replacement treatments, peritoneal dialysis (PD) exists either in the continuous ambulatory (CAPD) or automated (APD) mode, which requires continuous monitoring and strict control. Thus, several software systems have been proposed to perform reliable remote monitoring of patients using PD but also to achieve the goal with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction; i.e., in software engineering, this is called usability. However, few studies have addressed usability issues using case studies with patients and medical staff in real domains. In this paper, we present a usability assessment of a telemonitoring system for patients with CKD on peritoneal dialysis treatment through a case study with patients and medical staff of the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS). The usability evaluation was carried out through the application of two satisfaction instruments. These instruments evaluated multiple usability criteria, such as navigability, interactivity, motivation, satisfaction, and applicability. The results obtained from the usability evaluation show that, on average, the services offered by the system have 91.3% acceptance by users (patient-doctors), with the APD and CAPD exchange data registration services having the highest acceptance for patients, with a positive perception of 94.5% and 92.3%, respectively. Meanwhile, for the doctors and nurses, the alarm reception for patients in a risk situation was highest with 95% acceptance. Based on the obtained results, the evaluated telemonitoring system holds wide acceptance, satisfaction, and applicability from patients' and doctors' perspectives. It is also noted that the evaluated system considers and satisfies the requirements and suitable parameters that should be monitored in PD treatment according to studies presented in the literature. © 2018 Martínez García et al.

Piezologist is an unobtrusive chest worn device. It comprises a patch-type sensor and a mobile application. The sensor utilizes piezoelectric material as the cardiorespiratory signal sensing component and MetaWearC board as the signal acquisition unit. The board also comes with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) support which is utilized for the raw signal transmission. The novelty aspect of the system rests on the fact that not only using a single cheap piezoelectric sheet common cardiorespiratory parameters (such as heart rate, respiration rate, and cycles) were obtained similar to previous studies but ECG waveform and blood pressure data were also extracted successfully using the same sensor. In addition, sensor packaging design and prototyping and their effect on the acquired signal strength on one hand and the package size (volume and weight) on the other hand were studied and reported. For performance validation purpose, the developed cardiorespiratory monitoring sensor system results were validated against two commercial sensor devices namely 3-lead ECG sensor from eHealth sensor kit and Zephyr belt-type BioHarness sensor, and the results were reported herein. The validation process outcomes confirmed that the cardiorespiratory signals extracted using Piezologist conform with a heartbeat, respiratory cycle and ECG waveform obtained using the commercial sensors. Furthermore, a usability study was conducted to compare the user experience offered by Piezologist against commercially available sensors for measuring cardiorespiratory parameters. The study highlighted the potential that Piezologist will take over the commercial available belt-type, watch-type and 3-lead ECG sensors. © 2018 IEEE.","biomedical signal processing; cardiorespiratory; ECG waveform; heart rate extraction; Heartbeats; Home healthcare; mobile healthcare; Respiration rate; Sensors; Vital signs; wearable sensors","Application programs; Biomedical signal processing; Blood pressure; Body sensor networks; Electrocardiography; Health care; Heart; Intelligent systems; mHealth; Patient monitoring; Piezoelectricity; Sensors; Signal processing; Software design; Software prototyping; cardiorespiratory; ECG waveforms; Heart rates; Heartbeats; Home healthcare; Respiration rate; Vital sign; Wearable sensors",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85055510165

Stress management interventions can reduce distress and improve quality of life for cancer patients, but many people with cancer are unfortunately not offered or able to attend such in-person stress management interventions. Objective: The objective of this study was to develop an evidence-based stress management intervention for patients living with cancer that can be delivered electronically with wide reach and dissemination. This paper describes the design and development process of a technology-based stress management intervention for cancer survivors, including the exploration phase, intervention content development, iterative software development (including design, development, and formative evaluation of low- and high-level prototypes), and security and privacy considerations. Methods: Design and development processes were iterative and performed in close collaboration with key stakeholders (N=48). In the exploration phase, identifying needs and requirements for the intervention, 28 participants gave input, including male and female cancer survivors (n=11) representing a wide age range (31-81 years) and cancer diagnoses, healthcare providers (n=8) including psychosocial oncology experts, and eHealth experts (n=9) including information technology design and developers. To ensure user involvement in each phase various user-centered design and service design methods were included, such as interviews, usability testing, and think aloud processes. Overall, participants were involved usability testing in the software development and formative evaluation phase, including cancer survivors (n=6), healthy volunteers (n=7), health care providers (n=2), and eHealth experts (n=5). Intervention content was developed by stress management experts based on well-known cognitive behavioral stress management strategies and adjusted to electronic format through multiple iterations with stakeholders. Privacy and security issues were considered throughout. Results: The design and development process identified a variety of stakeholder requirements. Cancer survivors preferred stress management through a mobile app rather than through a personal computer (PC) and identified usefulness, easy access, user friendliness, use of easily understandable language, and many brief sections rather than longer ones as important components of the intervention. These requirements were also supported by recommendations from health care providers and eHealth experts. The final intervention was named StressProffen and the hospital Privacy and Security Protection Committee was part of the final intervention approval to also ensure anchoring in the hospital organization. Conclusions: Interventions, even evidence-based, have little impact if not actively used. This study illustrates how user-centered design and service design can be applied to identify and incorporate essential stakeholder aspects in the entire design and development process. In combination with evidence-based concepts, this process facilitated development of a stress management intervention truly designed for the end users, in this case, cancer survivors. © Elin Børøsund, Jelena Mirkovic, Matthew M Clark, Shawna L Ehlers, Michael A Andrykowski, Anne Bergland, Marianne Westeng, Lise Solberg Nes.

Medical devices have to be treated as complete systems and be evaluated in this manner. Instead of manufacturers having to ensure compliance to various regulatory standards individually, the authors previously developed a medical device software process assessment framework called MDevSPICE® that integrates the regulatory requirements from all the relevant medical device software standards. The MDevSPICE® was developed in a manner that suits plan-driven software development. To improve the usability of MDevSPICE® in agile settings, we extended the assessment approach. The hybrid assessment approach described here combines the MDevSPICE®-based process assessment method with steps for prioritization of improvement needs through value stream mapping and enabling process improvement through the use of KATA technique. This approach integrates agile methods into the medical device software development process while adhering to the requirements of the regulatory standards. This paper describes the implementation of the approach within 4 organizations that develop software in line with medical device regulations.

Antimicrobial treatment is a common therapy for patients in NICUs. To solve problems pertaining to empirical therapy, antimicrobial stewardship programs have recently been introduced. Despite the success of these programs in terms of data collection, there is still inefficiency in terms of analyzing and reporting the data. Thus, to successfully implement these stewardship programs, the design of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance systems is recommended as a first step. As a result, this study aimed to design an AMR surveillance system for use in the NICUs in northwestern Iranian hospitals to cover these information gaps. Methods: The recommended system is compatible with the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. The business intelligence (BI) requirements were extracted in an interview with a product owner (PO) using a valid and reliable checklist. Following this, an AMR surveillance system was designed and evaluated in relation to user experiences via a user experience questionnaire (UEQ). Finally, an association analysis was performed on the database, and the results were reported by identifying the important multidrug resistances in the database. Results: A customized software development methodology was proposed. The three major modules of the AMR surveillance are the data registry, dashboard, and decision support modules. The data registry module was implemented based on a three-tier architecture, and the Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) and dashboard modules were designed based on the BI requirements of the Scrum product owner (PO). The mean values of UEQ measures were in a good range. This measures showed the suitable usability of the AMR surveillance system. Conclusion: Applying efficient software development methodologies allows for the systems’ compatibility with users’ opinions and requirements. In addition, the construction of interdisciplinary communication models for research and software engineering allows for research and development concepts to be used in operational environments. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Drug resistance; Informatics; Iran; Microbial; Neonatal; Surveillance","Artificial intelligence; Client server computer systems; Decision support systems; Diagnosis; Drug therapy; Intensive care units; Microorganisms; Neonatal monitoring; Security systems; Space surveillance; Drug resistance; Informatics; Iran; Microbial; Neonatal; Software design; amikacin; ampicillin; antibiotic agent; cefazolin; cefepime; cefixime; cefotaxime; ceftazidime; ceftizoxime; ceftriaxone; ciprofloxacin; clindamycin; cotrimoxazole; erythromycin; gentamicin; imipenem; metronidazole; nalidixic acid; oxacillin; tetracycline; vancomycin; antiinfective agent; antibiotic resistance; Article; biosurveillance; checklist; clinical decision support system; data base; human; interview; Iran; knowledge discovery; multidrug resistance; neonatal intensive care unit; personal experience; practice guideline; priority journal; register; software; world health organization; newborn; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Decision Support Systems, Clinical; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Intensive Care Units, Neonatal; Iran",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046019859

They focus or on the professional who will use the software or on its usability or on the software engineering metrics or on financial and managerial issues. The existent approaches are very resources consuming, disconnected, and not standardized. As the software becomes more critical in the health organizations and in patients, becoming used as a medical device or a medicine, there is an urgency to identify tools and methods that can be applied in the development process. The present work is one of the steps of a broader study to identify standardized protocols to evaluate the health information systems as medicines and medical devices are evaluated by clinical trials. The goal of the present work was to evaluate the effect of the introduction of an information system for monitoring tuberculosis treatment (SISTB) in a Brazilian municipality from the patients’ perspective. The Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire and the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems were answered by the patients before and after the SISTB introduction, for comparison. Patients from an outpatient clinic, formed the control group, that is, at this site was not implanted the SISTB. Descriptive statistics and mixed effects model were used for data analysis. Eighty-eight interviews were conducted in the study. The questionnaire’s results presented better averages after the system introduction but were not considered statistically significant. Therefore, it was not possible to associate system implantation with improved patient satisfaction. The HIS evaluation need be complete, the technical and managerial evaluation, the safety, the impact on the professionals and direct and/or indirect impact on patients are important. Developing the right tools and methods that can evaluate the software in its entirety, from the beginning of the development cycle with a normalized scale, are needed. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Health information system evaluation; Patient relationship management; Patient satisfaction; Tuberculosis","adult; Article; assessment of humans; Brazil; Brazilian; case control study; clinical article; comparative study; controlled study; doctor patient relation; female; follow up; hospital admission; Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and System; hospitalization; human; interpersonal communication; male; medical information system; medication compliance; outpatient; outpatient department; patient monitoring; patient satisfaction; Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire; short course therapy; tuberculosis; clinical protocol; directly observed therapy; medical information system; methodology; middle aged; organization and management; patient satisfaction; socioeconomics; software design; total quality management; tuberculosis; tuberculostatic agent; Adult; Ambulatory Care Facilities; Antitubercular Agents; Brazil; Clinical Protocols; Directly Observed Therapy; Female; Health Information Systems; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Satisfaction; Quality Improvement; Research Design; Socioeconomic Factors; Software Design; Tuberculosis",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046691436

To achieve this goal, we suggest refactoring the legacy EHR systems into autonomous MicroServices communicating by the unified techniques such as RESTFul web service. This lets us handle clinical data queries directly and far more efficiently for both internal and external queries. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in avoiding the data de-identification process often used as a means of preserving patient privacy. The implemented toolkit combines software engineering technologies such as Java EE, RESTful web services, JSON Web Tokens to allow exchanging medical data in an unidentifiable XML and JSON format as well as restricting users to the need-to-know principle. Our technique also inhibits retrospective processing of data such as attacks by an adversary on a medical dataset using advanced computational methods to reveal Protected Health Information (PHI). The approach is validated on an endoscopic reporting application based on openEHR and MST standards. From the usability perspective, the approach can be used to query datasets by clinical researchers, governmental or non-governmental organizations in monitoring health care and medical record services to improve quality of care and treatment. © Ivyspring International Publisher.","EHR; EHR sharing; MicroService; Privacy-preserved","human; privacy; software; Humans; Privacy; Software",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048182911

Insomnia, however, is a prevalent sleep disorder that compromises functioning, productivity, and health. Therefore, developing efficient treatment delivery methods for insomnia can have significant societal and personal health impacts. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) is the recommended first-line treatment of insomnia but access is currently limited for patients, since treatment must occur in specialty sleep clinics, which suffer from an insufficient number of trained clinicians. Smartphone-based interventions offer a promising means for improving the delivery of CBTI. Furthermore, novel features such as real-time monitoring and assessment, personalization, dynamic adaptations of the intervention, and context awareness can enhance treatment personalization and effectiveness, and reduce associated costs. Ultimately, this “Just in Time Adaptive Intervention” for insomnia-an intervention approach that is acceptable to patients and clinicians, and is based on mobile health (mHealth) platform and tools-can significantly improve patient access and clinician delivery of evidence-based insomnia treatments. Objective: This study aims to develop and assess the usability of a Just in Time Adaptive Intervention application platform called iREST (“interactive Resilience Enhancing Sleep Tactics”) for use in behavioral insomnia interventions. iREST can be used by both patients and clinicians. Methods: The development of iREST was based on the Iterative and Incremental Development software development model. Requirement analysis was based on the case study's description, workflow and needs, clinician inputs, and a previously conducted BBTI military study/implementation of the Just in Time Adaptive Intervention architecture. To evaluate the usability of the iREST mHealth tool, a pilot usability study was conducted. Additionally, this study explores the feasibility of using an off-the-shelf wearable device to supplement the subjective assessment of patient sleep patterns. Results: The iREST app was developed from the mobile logical architecture of Just in Time Adaptive Intervention. It consists of a cross-platform smartphone app, a clinician portal, and secure 2-way communications platform between the app and the portal. The usability study comprised 19 Active Duty Service Members and Veterans between the ages of 18 and 60. Descriptive statistics based on in-app questionnaires indicate that on average, 12 (mean 12.23, SD 8.96) unique devices accessed the clinician portal per day for more than two years, while the app was rated as “highly usable”, achieving a mean System Usability Score score of 85.74 (SD 12.37), which translates to an adjective rating of “Excellent”. The participants also gave high scores on “ease of use and learnability” with an average score of 4.33 (SD 0.65) on a scale of 1 to 5. Conclusions: iREST provides a feasible platform for the implementation of Just in Time Adaptive Intervention in mHealth-based and remote intervention settings. The system was rated highly usable and its cross-platformness made it readily implemented within the heavily segregated smartphone market. The use of wearables to track sleep is promising; yet the accuracy of this technology needs further improvement. Ultimately, iREST demonstrates that mHealth-based Just in Time Adaptive Intervention is not only feasible, but also works effectively. © I Wayan Pulantara, Bambang Parmanto, Anne Germain.","Insomnia; IREST; JITAI; Just-in-Time Adaptive Intervention; MHealth; Mobile health; Sleep; Smartphone; Usability",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85047557849

However, the standards of two-level modeling such as openEHR appear complex to medical professionals. This study aims to investigate, implement, and improve the two-level modeling approach, and discusses the experience of building a unified data acquisition system for four affiliated university hospitals based on this approach. Method: After the investigation, we simplified the approach of archetype modeling and developed a medical data acquisition system where medical experts can define the metadata for their own specialties by using a visual easy-to-use tool. Result: The medical data acquisition system for multiple centers, clinical specialties, and diseases has been developed, and integrates the functions of metadata modeling, form design, and data acquisition. To date, 93,353 data items and 6,017 categories for 285 specific diseases have been created by medical experts, and over 25,000 patients’ information has been collected. Discussion and conclusion: OpenEHR is an advanced two-level modeling method for medical data, but its idea to separate domain knowledge and technical concern is not easy to realize. Moreover, it is difficult to reach an agreement on archetype definition. Therefore, we adopted simpler metadata modeling, and employed What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get (WYSIWYG) tools to further improve the usability of the system. Compared with the archetype definition, our approach lowers the difficulty. Nevertheless, to build such a system, every participant should have some knowledge in both medicine and information technology domains, as these interdisciplinary talents are necessary. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Data acquisition system; Electronic health record; Medical big data; Metadata modeling; Two-level model","Big data; Data acquisition; Dispensers; Medical computing; Metadata; Pinch effect; Software design; Data acquisition system; Domain knowledge; Electronic health record; Medical professionals; Metadata model; Multiple centers; Software development strategies; Two-level models; Medical information systems; Article; electronic health record; human; information processing; information technology; medical expert; medical information system; metadata; model; priority journal; diseases; information retrieval; medical record; metadata; procedures; software; standards; theoretical model; Disease; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval; Medical Record Linkage; Metadata; Models, Theoretical; Software",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041386049

An ongoing trend is to develop (semi-)autonomous socially assistive robotic systems in healthcare context to improve the level of autonomy and reduce human workload. This paper presents a behavior control system for social robots in therapies with a focus on personalization and platform-independence. This system architecture provides the robot an ability to behave as a personable character, which behaviors are adapted to user profiles and responses during the human-robot interaction. Robot behaviors are designed at abstract levels and can be transferred to different social robot platforms. We adopt the component-based software engineering approach to implement our proposed architecture to allow for the replaceability and reusability of the developed components. We introduce three different experimental scenarios to validate the usability of our system. Results show that the system is potentially applicable to different therapies and social robots. With the component-based approach, the system can serve as a basic framework for researchers to customize and expand the system for their targeted healthcare applications.

In particular, personal health record systems (PHR-Ss) empower self-care, essential to support lifestyle changes. Approaches such as the user-centered design (UCD), which is already a standard within the software industry (ISO 9241-210:2010), provide specifications and guidelines to guarantee user acceptance and quality of eHealth systems. However, no single PHR-S for metabolic syndrome (MS) developed following the recommendations of the ISO 9241-210:2010 specification has been found in the literature. Objective: The aim of this study was to describe the development of a PHR-S for the management of MS according to the principles and recommendations of the ISO 9241-210 standard. Methods: The proposed PHR-S was developed using a formal software development process which, in addition to the traditional activities of any software process, included the principles and recommendations of the ISO 9241-210 standard. To gather user information, a survey sample of 1,187 individuals, eight interviews, and a focus group with seven people were performed. Throughout five iterations, three prototypes were built. Potential users of each system evaluated each prototype. The quality attributes of efficiency, effectiveness, and user satisfaction were assessed using metrics defined in the ISO/IEC 25022 standard. Results: The following results were obtained: 1) a technology profile from 1,187 individuals at risk for MS from the city of Popayan, Colombia, identifying that 75.2% of the people use the Internet and 51% had a smartphone; 2) a PHR-S to manage MS developed (the PHR-S has the following five main functionalities: record the five MS risk factors, share these measures with health care professionals, and three educational modules on nutrition, stress management, and a physical activity); and 3) usability tests on each prototype obtaining the following results: 100% effectiveness, 100% efficiency, and 84.2 points in the system usability scale. Conclusion: The software development methodology used was based on the ISO 9241-210 standard, which allowed the development team to maintain a focus on user’s needs and requirements throughout the project, which resulted in an increased satisfaction and acceptance of the system. Additionally, the establishment of a multidisciplinary team allowed the application of considerations not only from the disciplines of software engineering and health sciences but also from other disciplines such as graphical design and media communication. Finally, usability testing allowed the observation of flaws in the designs, which helped to improve the solution. © 2018 Farinango et al.","Human-centered design; ISO 9241-210; Personal health record system; Software development process; Usability evaluation","adult; aged; Article; Colombia; electronic patient record; health care personnel; high risk population; human; human centered design; human computer interaction; human experiment; Internet; interview; metabolic syndrome X; middle aged; nutrition education; physical activity; pilot study; program effectiveness; risk factor; satisfaction; software design; standard; stress management",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041628011

However, the lack of standardization in the usability engineering processes used by the manufacturers, and the absence of pre-established metrics for such processes are constant problems in the medical device universe, particularly hindering the evaluation processes. It was verified that the current norms are insufficient to guarantee good usability engineering processes, even with the existence of good usability practices in the literature. Objective: This paper presents an analysis of the requirements contained in current standards and proposes a documentation model for usability engineering of medical devices, from the presentation of some techniques that are used in the process of device development. Method: This work is based on literature reviews to identify the state of the art in usability engineering; analysis of current standards, to verify what the regulatory requirements are, and how to comply with them; comparative studies with existing documentation to identify strengths and weaknesses in documentation processes; and elaboration of documentation prototypes. Results: From these results, it was possible to prepare a template document with all the points required by the current norms. Appropriate techniques were also listed for the accomplishment of some stages of the process, creating greater rigidity in the definition of the parameters of the documentation. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","ISO IEC 62366:2015; Software engineering; Usability","Biomedical engineering; Biomedical equipment; Medical problems; Software engineering; Appropriate techniques; Comparative studies; IEC 62366; International standards; Regulatory requirements; Regulatory standards; Usability; Usability engineering process; Usability engineering",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048212822

However, up to 88% of people with psychiatric symptoms still smoke, leading to high rates of disease and mortality. Therefore, there is a great need to develop smoking cessation interventions that have adequate levels of usability and can reach this population. Objective: The objective of this study was to report the rationale, ideation, design, user research, and final specifications of a novel smoking cessation app for people with serious mental illness (SMI) that will be tested in a feasibility trial. Methods: We used a variety of user-centered design methods and materials to develop the tailored smoking cessation app. This included expert panel guidance, a set of design principles and theory-based smoking cessation content, development of personas and paper prototyping, usability testing of the app prototype, establishment of app's core vision and design specification, and collaboration with a software development company. Results: We developed Learn to Quit, a smoking cessation app designed and tailored to individuals with SMI that incorporates the following: (1) evidence-based smoking cessation content from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy and US Clinical Practice Guidelines for smoking cessation aimed at providing skills for quitting while addressing mental health symptoms, (2) a set of behavioral principles to increase retention and comprehension of smoking cessation content, (3) a gamification component to encourage and sustain app engagement during a 14-day period, (4) an app structure and layout designed to minimize usability errors in people with SMI, and (5) a set of stories and visuals that communicate smoking cessation concepts and skills in simple terms. Conclusions: Despite its increasing importance, the design and development of mHealth technology is typically underreported, hampering scientific innovation. This report describes the systematic development of the first smoking cessation app tailored to people with SMI, a population with very high rates of nicotine addiction, and offers new design strategies to engage this population. mHealth developers in smoking cessation and related fields could benefit from a design strategy that capitalizes on the role visual engagement, storytelling, and the systematic application of behavior analytic principles to deliver evidence-based content.","Acceptance and commitment therapy; Gamification; Mhealth; Serious mental illness; Smoking cessation; User-centered design",,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041092605

It significantly promotes transparency, process reliability and reduces the proneness to errors. It also magnifies basic information by uniting functional or technical elements of one information system in an organized approach. Various organizations including universities encountered difficulties in managing a continually expanding volume of data concerning employees, students or its clienteles. This system provides an avenue for off-campus and distant offices to all educational resources and significant information connected through wireless network allowing to store necessary data in a reliable storage or information system for easier access to relevant data. The Multidimensional Application Grade of Interconnected and Locally Administered Services (MAGILAS) helps in interconnecting different offices for the delivery of necessary services to nominated stakeholders. It covers services of the following Service Departments and Offices: Registrar Services; Finance Services; Student Services and Development; Library Services; Research Development and Extension Training Services; Health Services; and Office of the Deans. Generally, the developed system met the objective of the university to produce and disseminate innovations and technologies in promoting sustainable development and streamlining its services. Essential data were gather by means of survey questionnaires given to the head of service units and selected students of the different colleges and department of the campus. The majority of the respondents were strongly agreed on usability level based from the result of System Usability Scale survey due to its respectable rating interpreted as “Excellent”. The outcomes of the management information system were increased in data availability, productivity and reliability. Hence, MAGILAS shows the dynamically inspired integrated software development. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.","Information system; Integrated system; Management information system; Network; Rapid application development","Digital storage; Information systems; Information use; Integrated control; Management information systems; Networks (circuits); Software design; Students; Surveys; Data availability; Educational resource; Integrated systems; Library services; Process reliability; Rapid application development; Research development; Training services; Information management",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85045532327

The availability of robust metrics in the early phases of the software development allows the better management of the later steps and a more efficient quality assessment when preventive or corrective actions can easily enhance quality. In this paper, we propose a set of cooperative Scrum based software metrics and architectural metrics that can be applied to cooperative ontology development and evolution process using Scrum framework. These metrics help improve cooperative teams' performance and improve the quality of development and evolution process of inter-organizational ontologies. Furthermore, most of these metrics can be applied easily to any daily ontology activities to ensure ontology reliability, maintainability, and usability. © 2017 IEEE.","architectural metric; ontology quality; software metrics; team performance","Knowledge engineering; Ontology; architectural metric; Corrective actions; Development process; Inter-organizational; Ontology development; Ontology qualities; Software metrics; Team performance; Software design",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046445516

An organization must perform a domain analysis to discover competing products, analyze their architectures and features, and ultimately discover and specify product requirements. However, delivering high quality products, depends not only on gaining an understanding of functional requirements, but also of qualities such as performance, reliability, security, and usability. Discovering such concerns early in the requirements process drives architectural design decisions. This paper extends our prior work on mining functional requirements from large collections of domain documents, by proposing and evaluating a new technique for discovering and specifying quality concerns related to specific functional components. We evaluate our approach against three domains of Positive Train Control, Electronic Health Records, and Medical Infusion Pumps, and show that it significantly outperforms a basic information retrieval approach.

To protect public health and ecosystems it is necessary to maintain the concentrations of pollutants below a safety threshold. In this context the development of models able to assess environmental pollution impact has been identified as a priority for future research. Scientific community has therefore produced many predictive models in the field. The vast majority of them needs to be run by specialists with a deep technical knowledge of the modeled phenomena in order to process the data and understand the results and it is not feasible to use this models for simple prescreening activities. Planners, evaluators and technical operators need reliable, usable and simple tools in order to carry out screening analysis of impact assessment. The ENVIFATE software is currently under development by the Department of Civil, environmental and mechanical engineering of the University of Trento, Italy, in the frame of a project funded by the Italian Veneto Region with the aim to make available to non-specialists screening analysis to assess the risks of a set of possible environmental pollution sources in protected areas. The development of ENVIFATE follows these basic requirements: i) Open-Source ii) multiplatform iii) user friendly iv) GIS oriented. In order to respect these principles we have chosen to develop a plugin of QGIS, using python as a development language and creating a module for each environmental compartment analyzed: rivers, lakes, atmospheric dispersion, dispersion in groundwater and noise. The plugin architecture is composed of a series of core functions characterized by command line interfaces that can be called from third-party applications (such as Grass GIS), connectable in custom data flows and with a high level of modularity and scalability. The base of the different models are highly tested and reliable algorithms adopted by the Italian Institute for Protection and Environmental Research (Istituto Superiore per la Protezione e la Ricerca Ambientale - ISPRA). Due to their simplicity, and for safety reasons, the structure of these models is constrained to provide conservative results, so to overestimate actual risk. This approach allows to provide statistically validated instruments to be used in different environmental contexts. All modules of the plugin provide numerical and cartographical results: in particular the command-line interface provides ""static"" results, or linked to a particular spatial and temporal state, while the Qgis plugins iterate the single analysis along space and time in order to provide geo-referenced maps and time distributed results. © Authors 2017.","Contamination modelling; Environment; GIS; Python; QGIS","Conservation; Geographic information systems; Groundwater; High level languages; Interface states; Open source software; Open systems; Pollution; Risk assessment; River pollution; Safety engineering; Software engineering; Atmospheric dispersion; Environment; Environmental compartment; Environmental pollutions; Environmental researches; Python; QGIS; Third party application (Apps); Environmental impact",Conference Paper,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027231170

Current challenges that physicians face include addressing EHR usability, system performance, adequate training, issue resolution, regulatory compliance, and lack of awareness of IT roles. These challenges lead to gaps in communication between clinicians and IT staff. Strategies to improve collaboration between physicians and IT staff include increasing physician involvement with health information technology software development, involvement with legislative regulations and standards, IT project implementation, as well as system stabilization and optimization. Other key strategies to improve collaboration are also addressed, including proper leadership support, proper training, and proper issue triage. Improved collaboration can result in more effective EHR design and implementation which in turn can enhance the end user experience and patient care. © 2017 American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation",,"awareness; electronic health record; human; interpersonal communication; leadership; medical education; medical informatics; patient care; physician; physician attitude; priority journal; Review; software; attitude to computers; electronic health record; interpersonal communication; Attitude to Computers; Communication; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Medical Informatics",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044331308

Compliance with accessibility guidelines does not guarantee blind users' satisfaction when accessing websites. Meanwhile, in recent years, websites have undergone radical changes regarding design, development, and construction. Responsive design is a new trend that has a strong impact on web design. To determine blind users' experience with responsive design, the authors performed empirical tests to investigate the impact of responsive design on the emotions of blind users during web interactions. They measured user emotions by applying the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) instrument. Results show that although the responsive websites investigated had acceptable levels of accessibility, they posed numerous usability barriers and triggered intense, negative user emotions. Furthermore, the average number of negative emotional reactions for blind users was higher in the case of responsive web design than in the case of nonresponsive web design. © 1994-2012 IEEE.","accessibility; blind user; HCI design and evaluation methods; healthcare; Internet/Web technologies; mobile; multimedia; software engineering; usability; user experience","Health care; Human rehabilitation equipment; Software engineering; Transportation; User interfaces; Websites; accessibility; Blind users; HCI design; mobile; multimedia; usability; User experience; Web Design",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019176536

The monitoring of such environmental factors allows for the development of appropriate strategies to reduce detrimental effects of sub-optimal air quality on the respiratory health of both livestock and farmers. In 2009, an environmental monitoring system was designed, developed and tested that allowed for the monitoring of a number of airborne pollutants. One limitation of the system was the manual collection of logged data from each unit. This paper identifies limitations of the current environmental monitoring system and suggests a range of networking technologies that can be used to increase usability. Consideration is taken for the networking of environmental monitoring units, as well as the collection of recorded data. Furthermore, the design and development of a software system that is used to collate and store recorded environmental data from multiple farms is explored. In order to design such a system, simplified software engineering processes and methodologies have been utilised. The main steps taken in order to complete the project were requirements elicitation with clients, requirements analysis, system design, implementation and finally testing. The outcome of the project provided a potential prototype for improving the environmental monitoring system and analysis informing the benefit of the implementation. © 2017 China Agricultural University","Environmental monitoring; Networking; Sensors; Software engineering","Agriculture; Air quality; Data acquisition; Environmental engineering; Environmental management; Environmental technology; Information management; Requirements engineering; Sensors; Software engineering; Design and Development; Environmental factors; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental monitoring system; Networking; Networking technology; Requirements elicitation; Software engineering process; Monitoring; air quality; data management; environmental monitoring; livestock; networking; sensor; software",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017022146

The Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires in Argentina developed an electronic health record with drug-drug interaction alerts, using traditional software engineering techniques and requirements. Despite enhancing the drug-drug interaction knowledge database, the alert override rate of this system was very high. We redesigned the alert system using user-centered design (UCD) and participatory design techniques to enhance the drug-drug interaction alert interface.

We used crossover method with realistic, clinical vignettes to compare usability of the standard and new software versions in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, and user satisfaction. Our study showed that, compared to the traditional alert system, the UCD alert system was more efficient (alerts faster resolution), more effective (tasks completed with fewer errors), and more satisfying.

Such a system was implemented in all wards in a tertiary academic hospital to explore the development process, core designs, functions, usability and feasibility. Methods The task-force team made user interface designs for 6 months based on a need analysis. Hardware configuration and software development was carried out for 3 months. We conducted a survey of 383 physicians and nurses to determine the usability and feasibility of the system. Results In March 2012, the system was installed in all wards, including the intensive care units, emergency rooms, operation rooms, and even delivery rooms. Healthcare professionals had access to all information of EHRs optimized for a large 55-inch touchscreen. The satisfaction rate of BESTBoard users was high, with a mean of 3.3 points. Voluntary users tended to consider BESTBoard as a good system that is useful for team round visits, interdisciplinary team approach, and collecting the status of the hospital rooms. Elderly users didn't tend to think of BESTBoard as a useful tool for interdisciplinary team approach and collecting the status of the hospital rooms. Greater expectations regarding work performance affected the users' attitudes positively. A positive attitude toward using the system resulted in consistent real usage and health care professionals' satisfaction with the new dashboard system. Conclusions A new concept of hospital dashboard system proved to be feasible and useful in delivering health information to healthcare professionals. A positive attitude and an expectation regarding work performance were important factors for intention to use the system. This finding can serve for developing new systems to present health information effectively. Further studies will be needed to evaluate the extent to which BESTBoard can have a positive impact on clinical care outcomes and work performance. © 2016","Dashboard system; Electronic heath record; Hospital information system; User experience study","Health care; Hospitals; Intensive care units; User interfaces; Dashboard system; Electronic heath record; Hardware configurations; Health care professionals; Hospital information systems; Interdisciplinary teams; User experience; User interface designs; Software design; adult; Article; bestboard system; computer; delivery room; emergency ward; female; health care personnel; health personnel attitude; health practitioner; human; intensive care unit; job performance; male; medical information system; middle aged; normal human; operating room; priority journal; satisfaction; software; surgical ward; young adult; behavior; benchmarking; health care quality; health personnel attitude; hospital emergency service; mass communication; nurse; physician; procedures; psychology; questionnaire; utilization; Adult; Attitude of Health Personnel; Benchmarking; Diffusion of Innovation; Emergency Service, Hospital; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Intention; Male; Middle Aged; Nurses; Physicians; Quality Assurance, Health Care; Software; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84991237109

Moving away from the traditional approach where the user has to settle for the options offered by software systems, different factors, like user needs, aspirations, preferences, knowledge level, goals and other distinguishing features, have to be taken into account for this purpose. Technically, this possibility is referred to as adaptiveness, and it requires user data. It is these data (user model) that determine the adaptiveness conditions. Our aim is to build a user model for adaptive systems applied to nutritional requirements, modelling user characteristics that affect their diets and help to improve their health. To build the user model, we apply the user profile usability technique. In order to validate our proposal, we analyse and design a preliminary prototype of an adaptive system capable of making food recommendations to satisfy specific user needs. This study revealed that diet is a propitious field for the development of adaptive systems and that user modelling is a good choice for design of this type of systems.","Diets; Human Computer-Interaction; Software engineering; Usability techniques; User modelling; User profiling","Computer software; Cybernetics; Human computer interaction; Nutrition; Software engineering; Design and implementations; Software analysis; Traditional approaches; Usability techniques; User characteristics; User Modelling; User profiling; User requirements; Adaptive systems",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032641436

Although several image segmentation algorithms have been proposed for different applications, no universal method currently exists. Moreover, their use is usually limited when detection of complex and multiple adjacent objects of interest is needed. In addition, the continually increasing volumes of medical imaging scans require more efficient segmentation software design and highly usable applications. In this context, we present an extension of our previous segmentation framework which allows the combination of existing explicit deformable models in an efficient and transparent way, handling simultaneously different segmentation strategies and interacting with a graphic user interface (GUI). We present the object-oriented design and the general architecture which consist of two layers: the GUI at the top layer, and the processing core filters at the bottom layer. We apply the framework for segmenting different real-case medical image scenarios on public available datasets including bladder and prostate segmentation from 2D MRI, and heart segmentation in 3D CT. Our experiments on these concrete problems show that this framework facilitates complex and multi-object segmentation goals while providing a fast prototyping open-source segmentation tool. © 2017 SPIE.","Medical Imaging Analysis; Multiple Segmentation Framework; Parallel Segmentation","Application programs; Bioinformatics; Computerized tomography; Graphical user interfaces; Magnetic resonance imaging; Medical image processing; Medical imaging; Object oriented programming; Open source software; Open systems; Software design; Software engineering; User interfaces; General architectures; Graphic user interface (GUI); Image segmentation algorithm; Imaging analysis; Multi-object segmentation; Multiple segmentation; Object oriented design; Parallel segmentations; Image segmentation",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85038413590

The system consists of a breast imaging database with breast density types classified and demarcated by the specialist (tutor) or online database. The planning was based on ISO / IEC 12207. Through the browser (desktop or notebook), the user will visualize the breast images and in them will realize the markings of the density region and even classify them per the BI-RADS protocol. After marking, this will be compared to the gold standard already existing in the image base, and then the system will inform if the area demarcation has been set or not. The shape of this marking is similar to the paint brush. The evaluation was based on ISO / IEC 1926 or 25010: 2011 by 3 software development specialists and 3 in mammary radiology, evaluating usability, configuration, performance and System interface through the Likert scale-based questionnaire.

This however depends on comprehensive and verifiable safety requirements to leverage these techniques for detecting and preventing flaws in UI software that can induce use errors. This paper presents a hazard analysis method that extends Leveson’s System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) with a comprehensive set of causal factor categories, so as to provide developers with clear guidelines for systematic identification of use-related hazards associated with medical devices, their causes embedded in UI software design, and safety requirements for mitigating such hazards. The method is evaluated with a case study on the Gantry-2 radiation therapy system, which demonstrates that (1) as compared to standard STPA, our method allowed us to identify more UI software design issues likely to cause use-related hazards; and (2) the identified UI software design issues facilitated the definition of precise, verifiable safety requirements for UI software, which could be readily formalized in verification tools such as Prototype Verification System (PVS). © Springer International Publishing AG (outside the US) 2017.","Medical devices; Requirements identification/formalization; User interface software","Biomedical equipment; Computer software selection and evaluation; Formal methods; Formal verification; Hazards; Radiation hazards; Safety engineering; Safety factor; Software design; Software engineering; Verification; Medical Devices; Prototype verification systems; Radiation therapy systems; Requirements identification/formalization; Safety requirements; Systematic identification; User interface software; Verification tools; User interfaces",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029005107

In particular, we focus on perceptions in using the app for ameliorating worry, as well as on understanding in situ usage. We employ thematic analysis to qualitatively analyze participants' interviews at the end of a 5-week study period. Results indicate that several participants experienced decentering from their worries when using the app. Moreover, AEON was perceived as easy and pleasant to use. However, results also highlight that some participants did not experience decentering from all or some of their worries, and we discuss the possible reasons.

We investigated with the presented study how the concept of usability is currently understood and implemented in medical software companies. Interviews were conducted with 21 employees of German enterprises. Furthermore we extended an already existing quantitative online survey where 53 companies (including 24 from the health industry sector) participated in. Results show that the importance of usability is recognized by most of the respondents. Moreover, a wide variety of methods and approaches is known and implemented for exploring user needs and evaluating system prototypes. However, it was observed that human-centered design activities mainly focus on functionality, risk prevention and accessibility. Hedonic user needs and subjective perceptions (“user experience”) still play a minor role.

Within safety critical domains such as medical device software, this increasing complexity is placing growing demands on manufacturers who must ensure their software not only meets functional requirements but is also safe and reliable. However, the Food and Drugs Administration who regulate medical device software in the United States report a significant increase in recalls between years 2003 and 2012 and have cited software difficulties as one of the frequent causes of recalls. Furthermore a recent analysis of traceability documentation submitted to the Administration has revealed that the traceability data was incomplete, incorrect, and conflicting in many cases. This is problematic as traceability plays an important role in the development of safe and reliable software. In this paper we present the validation, through industry trial, of a traceability assessment and implementation framework which we have developed to assist medical device organizations implement traceability in an efficient and regulatory compliant manner. Our findings show that implementation of the framework within two organizations improved their traceability process and that both organizations found the framework to be both useful and usable. © 2016, Association for Computing Machinery, Inc.

Automation has already been studied in a number of (sub-) disciplines and application fields: design, human factors, psychology, (software) engineering, aviation, health care, games. One distinguishing feature of the area we are focusing on is that in the field of interactive critical systems properties such as reliability, dependability, faulttolerance are as important as usability, user experience or overall acceptance issues. The SIG targets at two problem areas: first the engineering of the user interaction with (partly-) autonomous systems: how to design, build and assess autonomous behavior, especially in cases where there is a need to represent on the user interface both autonomous and interactive objects. An example of such integration is the representation of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) (where no direct interaction is possible), together with aircrafts (that have to be instructed by an air traffic controller to avoid the UAV). Second the design and engineering of user interaction in general for autonomous objects/systems (for example a cruise control in a car or an autopilot in an aircraft). The goal of the SIG is to raise interest in the CHI community on the general aspects of automation and to identify a community of researchers and practitioners interested in those increasingly prominent issues of interfaces towards (semi)-autonomous systems. The expected audience should be interested in addressing the issues of integration of mainly unconnected research domains to formulate a new joint research agenda. © 2016 Authors.","Acceptance; Automation; Human error; Interactive systems engineering; Reliability; Safety critical systems; Usability; User experience","Air navigation; Air traffic control; Aircraft control; Application programs; Cruise control; Fighter aircraft; Graphical user interfaces; Human computer interaction; Human engineering; Reliability; Safety engineering; Traffic control; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); User interfaces; Acceptance; Human errors; Interactive systems engineering; Safety critical systems; Usability; User experience; Automation",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014699297

Processing and analyzing NGS data is challenging. NGS data are big, heterogeneous, sparse, and error prone. Although a plethora of tools for NGS data analysis has emerged in the past decade, (i) software development is still lagging behind data generation capabilities, and (ii) there is a 'cultural' gap between the end user and the developer. Text: Generic software template libraries specifically developed for NGS can help in dealing with the former problem, whilst coupling template libraries with visual programming may help with the latter. Here we scrutinize the state-of-the-art low-level software libraries implemented specifically for NGS and graphical tools for NGS analytics. An ideal developing environment for NGS should be modular (with a native library interface), scalable in computational methods (i.e. serial, multithread, distributed), transparent (platform-independent), interoperable (with external software interface), and usable (via an intuitive graphical user interface). These characteristics should facilitate both the run of standardized NGS pipelines and the development of new workflows based on technological advancements or users' needs. We discuss in detail the potential of a computational framework blending generic template programming and visual programming that addresses all of the current limitations. Conclusion: In the long term, a proper, well-developed (although not necessarily unique) software framework will bridge the current gap between data generation and hypothesis testing. This will eventually facilitate the development of novel diagnostic tools embedded in routine healthcare. © 2016 Milicchio et al.","Big data; Generic programming; Graphical user interface; High-throughput sequencing; Next-generation sequencing; Software suite; Template library; Visual programming","computer aided design; computer analysis; computer graphics; computer interface; computer program; conceptual framework; data analysis; genetic database; human; information processing; mathematical computing; next generation sequencing; priority journal; process development; Review; sequence analysis; visual programming",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84966318348

Important barriers include an emphasis on algorithmic approaches to decision support that do not align well with clinical work flow and human decision strategies, and the expense and challenge of developing, implementing, and refining decision support features in existing electronic health records (EHRs). We applied decision-centered design to create a modular software application to support physicians in managing and tracking colorectal cancer screening. Using decision-centered design facilitates a thorough understanding of cognitive support requirements from an end user perspective as a foundation for design. In this project, we used an iterative design process, including ethnographic observation and cognitive task analysis, to move from an initial design concept to a working modular software application called the Screening & Surveillance App. The beta version is tailored to work with the Veterans Health Administration's EHR Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS). Primary care providers using the beta version Screening & Surveillance App more accurately answered questions about patients and found relevant information more quickly compared to those using CPRS alone.

A critical evaluation framework is required to ensure the usability and reliability of mobile health education applications in order to facilitate the saving of time and effort for the various user groups; thus, the aim of this paper is to describe a framework for evaluating mobile applications for health education. The intended outcome of this framework is to meet the needs and requirements of the different user categories and to improve the development of mobile health education applications with software engineering approaches, by creating new and more effective techniques to evaluate such software. This paper first highlights the importance of mobile health education apps, then explains the need to establish an evaluation framework for these apps. The paper provides a description of the evaluation framework, along with some specific evaluation metrics: an efficient hybrid of selected heuristic evaluation (HE) and usability evaluation (UE) factors to enable the determination of the usefulness and usability of health education mobile apps. Finally, an explanation of the initial results for the framework was obtained using a Medscape mobile app. The proposed framework - An Evaluation Framework for Mobile Health Education Apps - is a hybrid of five metrics selected from a larger set in heuristic and usability evaluation, filtered based on interviews from patients and health professionals. These five metrics correspond to specific facets of usability identified through a requirements analysis of typical users of mobile health apps. These metrics were decomposed into 21 specific questionnaire questions, which are available on request from first author. © 2016.","Evaluation Framework; Health Professionals; Heuristic Evaluation; Metrics; Usability Evaluation","Application programs; mHealth; Mobile computing; Mobile telecommunication systems; Software engineering; Usability engineering; Evaluation framework; Health professionals; Heuristic evaluation; Metrics; Usability evaluation; Health",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85022331212

Therefore, a systematic mapping review was conducted in order to identify the most commonly used usability evaluation techniques in software developments. A total of 1169 studies were identified, of which only 215 studies were selected for this review. According to the analysis, most cases studies establish the use of usability questionnaires as assessment tool. In addition, health informatics and Web applications are the software domain and type of application that are frequently reported in these evaluations. This work has allowed to reach promising results in this area. It is intended to be a guide for specialists to support the choice of the most suitable method for a particular scenario. © 2016 SERSC.","Human-computer interaction; Software development process; Systematic mapping review; Usability evaluation methods; User-centered design",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84957620546

This case study describes a potassium chloride overdose in a hospitalized patient that occurred despite the use of electronic ordering. Several important aspects of the serious adverse event were in fact attributable to failures in interaction with a system that had many design and functional characteristics inconsistent with common usability conventions and principles of cognitive engineering. Cognitive errors with the potential to engender adverse events may occur relatively frequently when complex information technology is used routinely in safety-critical work environments.

Key requirements for any such e-health systems and any subsequent business exploitation are tailor-made design and proper evaluation. This paper presents the design, implementation, wide deployment, and evaluation of the low cost, physical exercise, and gaming (exergaming) FitForAll (FFA) platform system usability, user adherence to exercise, and efficacy are explored. The design of FFA is tailored to elderly populations, distilling literature guidelines and recommendations. The FFA architecture introduces standard physical exercise protocols in exergaming software engineering, as well as, standard physical assessment tests for augmented adaptability through adjustable exercise intensity. This opens up the way to next generation exergaming software, which may be more automatically/smartly adaptive. 116 elderly users piloted FFA five times/week, during an eight-week controlled intervention. Usability evaluation was formally conducted (SUS, SUMI questionnaires). Control group consisted of a size-matched elderly group following cognitive training. Efficacy was assessed objectively through the senior fitness (Fullerton) test, and subjectively, through WHOQoL-BREF comparisons of pre-postintervention between groups. Adherence to schedule was measured by attendance logs. The global SUMI score was 68.33±5.85%, while SUS was 77.7. Good usability perception is reflected in relatively high adherence of 82% for a daily two months pilot schedule. Compared to control group, elderly using FFA improved significantly strength, flexibility, endurance, and balance while presenting a significant trend in quality of life improvements. This is the first elderly focused exergaming platform intensively evaluated with more than 100 participants. The use of formal tools makes the findings comparable to other studies and forms an elderly exergaming corpus. © 2014 IEEE.",,"Design; Health; Network architecture; Software engineering; Software testing; Sports; Surveys; Cognitive training; e-Health systems; Elderly populations; Exercise intensity; Physical exercise; Platform systems; Post interventions; Usability evaluation; Quality control; aged; computer program; consensus development; control group; controlled study; endurance; exercise intensity; human; major clinical study; normal human; perception; quality of life; questionnaire; computer interface; devices; female; fitness; kinesiotherapy; male; middle aged; physiology; pilot study; procedures; very elderly; video game; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Exercise Therapy; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Physical Fitness; Pilot Projects; Quality of Life; User-Computer Interface; Video Games",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84971516901

This is transformed into an agent-based model, from which a skeleton of programming code is generated. A case study illustrates this approach. Moreover, 24 engineers expert in model-driven engineering, multi-agent systems and/or health experienced the current approach alongside the three most similar works, by implementing actual systems.

However, PCC information systems are not designed to facilitate HIE with EDs; therefore, we are developing specialized software to support HIE within the normal workflow of the PCC using user-centered design and rapid prototyping. Objective: To describe the design of an HIE dashboard and the refinement of user requirements through rapid prototyping. Methods: Using previously elicited user requirements, we designed low-fidelity sketches of designs on paper with iterative refinement. Next, we designed an interactive high-fidelity prototype and conducted scenario-based usability tests with end users. Users were asked to think aloud while accomplishing tasks related to a case vignette. After testing, the users provided feedback and evaluated the prototype using the System Usability Scale (SUS). Results: Survey results from three users provided useful feedback that was then incorporated into the design. After achieving a stable design, we used the prototype itself as the specification for development of the actual software. Benefits of prototyping included having 1) subject-matter experts heavily involved with the design; 2) flexibility to make rapid changes, 3) the ability to minimize software development efforts early in the design stage; 4) rapid finalization of requirements; 5) early visualization of designs; 6) and a powerful vehicle for communication of the design to the programmers.

Given the amount of time we spend inside buildings, the indoor environmental quality has a strong influence on our productivity and health. We developed the system SmartSpaces that aggregates and visualizes environmental data in a smartphone application. The goal is to provide access to this data such that users can understand and improve the factors that influence their well-being. User interface guidelines for visualizing the environmental quality are proposed. We describe a case study of occupants in a smart building that allows them to access the data. The findings show that usability and transparency increase the users' awareness of the environmental quality. This can lead to a behavioral change and therefore improve the users' health and productivity, and optimize the energy consumption of buildings. © Copyright 2016 for the individual papers by the papers' authors.","Cyber-physical systems; Indoor environmental quality; Internet of things; Mobile application; Smart buildings; Smart environments; Visualization","Buildings; Embedded systems; Energy utilization; Flow visualization; Intelligent buildings; Internet of things; Productivity; User interfaces; Visualization; Behavioral changes; Cyber physical systems (CPSs); Environmental quality; Indoor environmental quality; Mobile applications; Smart environment; Smart-phone applications; User interface guidelines; Software engineering",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84964241006

Heart starters are, for example, available in public places and used by non-professionals. Different mobile medical applications, designed to help people manage their own health, are now being added to the medical device spectra. Users handling medical devices make errors, but by involving users in the risk management process, it is possible to lower the risk of these errors. This paper presents an evaluation of the value of complementing a traditional risk management process with an emphasised user perspective. A medical device software risk management framework is being designed, and the risk management process should be regarded as the first part of the framework. The main goal of the evaluated risk management process is to integrate users and user perspective into the risk management process. The results indicate that the use of use cases as input at risk meetings makes the discussions more focused, saving effort and time. When users attend the risk meetings, user perspective and domain knowledge are brought into the process, affecting risk identification and risk assessment. The results also show that the use of usability testing gives valuable input to the risk management process.

Applications from different categories - including commercial and enterprise email, instant messaging, social, banking, insurance and retail - access, process and transmit over the network numerous pieces of sensitive information, such as the user's geographical location, device ID, contacts, calendar events, passwords, and health records, as well as credit-card, social-security, and bank-account numbers. Understanding and managing how an application handles private data is a significant challenge. There are not only multiple sources of such data (including primarily social accounts, user inputs and platform libraries), but also different release targets (such as advertising companies and application servers) and different forms of release (for example, passwords transmitted in the clear, hashed or encrypted). To the end users, and particularly those who are not tech savvy, it is nontrivial to manage these complexities. In response, we have designed Labyrinth, a system for privacy enforcement. The unique features of Labyrinth are (i) an intuitive visual interface for configuration of the privacy policy, which consists of enriched app screen captures annotated with privacy-related information, combined with (ii) a lightweight mechanism to detect and suppress privacy threats that is completely decoupled from the host platform. Labyrinth supports both Android and iOS. In this paper, we describe the Labyrinth architecture and illustrate its flow steps. © 2015 IEEE.","Android; Dynamic Analysis; iOS; Mobile; Privacy; Security; Usable Security","Android (operating system); Authentication; Data privacy; Dynamic analysis; iOS (operating system); Software engineering; Android; Application Servers; Contextual information; Geographical locations; Mobile; Security; Sensitive informations; Usable security; Mobile security",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84961126062

Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY, United States","Mobile devices have revolutionized many aspects of our lives. We use smartphones and tablets as portable computers and, often without realizing it, we run various types of security-sensitive programs on them, such as personal and enterprise email and instant-messaging applications, as well as social, banking, insurance and retail programs. These applications access and transmit over the network numerous pieces of private information, including our geographical location, device ID, contacts, calendar events, passwords, and health records, as well as credit-card, social-security, and bank-account numbers. Guaranteeing that no private information is exposed to unauthorized observers is very challenging given the level of complexity that these applications have reached. Furthermore, using program-analysis tools with out-of-the-box configurations in order to detect confidentiality violations may not yield the desired results because only a few pieces of private data, such as the device's ID and geographical location, are obtained from standard sources. The majority of confidentiality sources (such as credit-card and bank-account numbers) are application-specific and require careful configuration. This paper presents Labyrinth, a run-time privacy enforcement system that automatically detects leakage of private data originating from standard as well as application-specific sources. Labyrinth features several novel contributions: (i) it allows for visually configuring, directly atop the application's User Interface (UI), the fields that constitute custom sources of private data, (ii) it does not require operating-system instrumentation, but relies only an application-level instrumentation and on a proxy that intercepts the communication between the mobile device and the back-end servers, and (iii) it performs an enhanced form of value-similarity analysis to detect data leakage even when sensitive data (such as a password) has been encoded or hashed. Labyrinth supports both Android and iOS. We have evaluated Labyrinth experimentally, and in this paper we report results on production-level applications. © 2015 IEEE.","Android; Dynamic Analysis; iOS; Mobile; Privacy; Security; Usable Security","Android (operating system); Application programs; Authentication; Complex networks; Computer aided software engineering; Data privacy; Data visualization; Dynamic analysis; Information management; iOS (operating system); Microcomputers; Mobile devices; Personal computers; User interfaces; Android; Application specific; Geographical locations; Mobile; Private information; Security; Similarity analysis; Usable security; Mobile security",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84958162937

Internet based self-care systems have been advocated for over a decade as a way to reduce costs and allow more convenient care, and-because of the expectation that they will be used to reduced health cost -, by increasing self-care and avoiding hospitalization. However, the history of consumer eHealth interventions is mixed, with many unsuccessful implementations. Many consumer eHealth products will form part of a broader complex intervention, with many possible benefits and effects on both individuals and society.

We conducted ethnographic observations and CTA interviews to identify common elements of clinical workflow across health systems and articulate decision requirements. We describe three design iterations that emerged over the course of CTA and software development. Findings from a beta test evaluating the SSA suggest that it saves time, increases accuracy in responding to CRC-related patient-specific questions, and is perceived to reduce workflow as compared to participants' current electronic health records (EHR).

As a result, new pilot programs and clinical trials continue to be launched to establish clinical evidence. However, the continual need for software changes between iterations of the trial creates a lengthy time loop between clinical researchers requesting a change and software developers implementing the requested change. We propose a new methodology for performing clinical trials, called ScaleMed. The ScaleMed methodology involves decoupling low-level app functionality from high-level trial-related operational parameters, a common software development practice. By utilizing a centralized website that allows clinical researchers to rapidly update these trial parameters, iterative clinical trials have the potential to move at a much faster rate than in current practice. We demonstrate an example of the ScaleMed methodology applied to an ongoing mental health trial (codenamed Lucy). In addition, we conducted a separate trial on the usability of the ScaleMed-enabled Lucy platform and found a predominantly positive response from the potential clinical users. In our limited trials, we showed that the time to make changes to app parameters was cut from weeks to less than a minute. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Application programs; mHealth; Software design; Clinical researchers; Common software; Current practices; Healthcare monitoring; Operational parameters; Pilot programs; Software change; Software developer; Iterative methods",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84966638852

Users are then faced with the question of whether the upgrade is worth the price and the trouble. The software industry doesn't provide much evidence that it's worthwhile to upgrade to new releases. The authors propose the use of process mining to prove that upgrading to the next release provides quantifiable benefits to the end user. Process mining capitalizes on the fact that event logs capture information about processes. These events can be used to make processes visible and show the benefits of using a software product's next release. Three groups benefits from this process: end users, software suppliers, and researchers. The authors applied process mining to a medical software product and captured empirical data from 1,400 cases.

In 2008-2011 we developed and trialled web-based software to facilitate a randomised trial of a shared-care approach for childhood obesity involving General Practitioners (GPs) working with tertiary specialists. We describe the software's development, implementation and evaluation, and make recommendations for future e-health initiatives. The web-based software was designed with the goals of allowing both GPs and specialists to communicate and review patient progress; integrating with existing GP software; and supporting GPs to deliver the structured intervention. Specifically, we aimed to highlight the challenges inherent in this process, and report on the extent to which the software ultimately met its implementation and user aims. Methods. The study was conducted at the Royal Children's Hospital and 22 general practices across Melbourne, Australia. Participants comprised 30 GPs delivering the shared-care intervention. Outcomes included the following. (1) GPs' pre-specified software requirements: transcribed from two focus groups and analysed for themes using content analysis. (2) Software implementation and performance based on the experience of the research team and GPs. (3) GP users' evaluation collected via questionnaire. (4) Software usage collected via GP questionnaire and qualified through visual inspection of the software meta-data. Results: Software implementation posed difficult and at times disabling technological barriers (e.g. out-dated hardware, poor internet connections). The software's speed and inability to seamlessly link with day-to-day software was a source of considerable frustration. Overall, GPs rated software usability as poor, although most (68%) felt that the structure and functionality of the software was useful. Recommendations for future e-health initiatives include thorough scoping of IT systems and server speed, testing across diverse environments, automated pre-requisite checks and upgrades of processors/memory where necessary, and user-created usernames and passwords. Conclusions: GPs are willing to embrace novel technologies to support their practice. However, implementation remains challenging mainly for technical reasons, and this precludes further evaluation of potential user-specific barriers. These findings could inform future e-health ventures into shared-care, and highlight the need for an appropriate infrastructure. Trial registration.

We report here (1) a novel approach to data sharing between collaborating scientists that brings together file system tools and cloud technologies, (2) a service implementing this approach, called NeuronDepot, and (3) an example application of the service to a complex use case in the neurosciences. The main drivers for our approach are to facilitate collaborations with a transparent, automated data flow that shields scientists from having to learn new tools or data structuring paradigms. Using NeuronDepot is simple: one-time data assignment from the originator and cloud based syncing-thus making experimental and modeling data available across the collaboration with minimum overhead. Since data sharing is cloud based, our approach opens up the possibility of using new software developments and hardware scalabitliy which are associated with elastic cloud computing. We provide an implementation that relies on existing synchronization services and is usable from all devices via a reactive web interface. We are motivating our solution by solving the practical problems of the GinJang project, a collaboration of three universities across eight time zones with a complex workflow encompassing data from electrophysiological recordings, imaging, morphological reconstructions, and simulations. © 2014 Rautenberg, Kumaraswamy, Tejero-Cantero, Doblander, Norouzian, Kai, Jacobsen, Ai, WachtlerandIkeno.","Cloud services; Data management; Electrophysiology; Imaging; Morphology; Neuroinformatics; Research data management","article; backup; computer interface; computer security; confocal microscopy; data flow; data integration; data mangement; dendrite; electrophysiology; imaging; information processing; local file system; medical informatics; morphology; neuroanatomy; registration; simulation; storage service; Web application; work station",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84902590974

Wishard Hospital and Regenstrief remain committed to homegrown software development, and over the past 4 years we have fully rebuilt Gopher with an emphasis on usability, safety, leveraging open source technologies, and the advancement of biomedical informatics research. Our objective in this paper is to summarize the functionality of this new system and highlight its novel features. Materials and methods: Applying a user-centered design process, the new Gopher was built upon a rich-internet application framework using an agile development process. The system incorporates order entry, clinical documentation, result viewing, decision support, and clinical workflow. We have customized its use for the outpatient, inpatient, and emergency department settings. Results: The new Gopher is now in use by over 1100 users a day, including an average of 433 physicians caring for over 3600 patients daily. The system includes a wizard-like clinical workflow, dynamic multimedia alerts, and a familiar 'e-commerce'-based interface for order entry. Clinical documentation is enhanced by real-time natural language processing and data review is supported by a rapid chart search feature. Discussion: As one of the few remaining academically developed order entry systems, the Gopher has been designed both to improve patient care and to support next-generation informatics research. It has achieved rapid adoption within our health system and suggests continued viability for homegrown systems in settings of close collaboration between developers and providers. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Clinical decision support systems; Computerized physician order entry system; Electronic health record; Health information technology","Clinical decision support systems; Computerized order entries; Computerized physician order entry systems; Electronic health record; Electronic medical record system; Health information technologies; NAtural language processing; User-centered design process; Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Hospitals; Information technology; Medical computing; Natural language processing systems; Internet protocols; allergy; article; clinical decision making; commercial phenomena; computer interface; computerized provider order entry; conceptual framework; decision support system; electronic medical record; emergency ward; hospital patient; Internet; medical assessment; medical documentation; medical information system; multimedia; natural language processing; outpatient; patient care; physician; priority journal; treatment planning; workflow; Clinical decision support systems; Computerized physician order entry system; Electronic health record; Health information technology; Automatic Data Processing; Documentation; Hospitals, University; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval; Medical Records Systems, Computerized; Patient Care; Software; User-Computer Interface",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84892488437

In United Arab Emirates (UAE), where this study on Emirati children was conducted, over 20% of the population has diabetes. With such a high incidence, there is a need to raise the awareness of the disease in order to reduce the growing number of cases and manage the disease more effectively. This research aims to identify the needs of affected children and proposes a design for an E-learning prototype that can pedagogically raise their awareness and knowledge of the disease. The use of a prototype was chosen in order to validate and refine the usability of the system, and to quickly evaluate user-interface designs without the need for an expensive working model to help refine and develop the system design. The system requirements were identified through a set of interviews with kindergarten teachers, curriculum design experts in UAE, and diabetes nutrition specialists and clinicians. The rationale behind the interview was to identify the optimal age group, describe the appropriate level of the instructional materials and activities, and propose a suitable learning approach that could facilitate and improve diabetes awareness among this age group. The prototype was evaluated by children, teachers, parents (or guardians) and nutrition specialists. We followed a three-stage software development based on a user-informed approach model for stepwise refinement that ranged from prototype to final design. The evaluation results indicate that the proposed computer-supported learning approach can generate positive learning and behavior in children while reducing the time needed to complete awareness tasks when compared to traditional methods; thus making learning more engaging and allowing children to learn at their own pace. © 2014 Informa UK Ltd.

But, things have changed! Software has become more ubiquitous. Software is used in products that are governed by regulation. Software is being developed in organisations that heretofore did not consider themselves software companies - such as automotive and medical device companies.

Design approaches that optimize usability are commonplace in the software development industry but are seldom used in the development of e-learning resources, especially in medical education. We conducted a usability evaluation of a multimedia resource for teaching electrolyte and acid-base disorders by studying the interaction of 15 medical doctors with the application. Most of the usability problems occurred in an interactive treatment simulation, which was completed successfully by only 20% of participants. A total of 27 distinct usability problems were detected, with 15 categorized as serious. No differences were observed with respect to usability problems detected by junior doctors as compared with more experienced colleagues. Problems were related to user information and feedback, the visual layout, match with the real world, error prevention and management, and consistency and standards. The resource was therefore unusable for many participants; this is in contrast to good scores previously reported for subjective user satisfaction. The findings suggest that the development of e-learning materials should follow an iterative design-and-test process that includes routine usability evaluation. User testing should include the study of objective measures and not rely only on self-reported measures of satisfaction. © 2013 British Educational Research Association.",,"E-learning; Electrolytes; Human computer interaction; Medical education; Multimedia systems; Software design; Testing; Acid-base disorders; E-learning materials; E-learning resources; Multimedia e-learning; Multimedia resources; Software development industries; Treatment simulation; Usability evaluation; Usability engineering",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84894043689

In this context software failures may produce enormous losses, either economical or, in the worst case, in human lives. Software analysis is an area in software engineering concerned with the application of diverse techniques in order to prove the absence of errors in software pieces. In many cases different analysis techniques are applied by following specific methodological combinations that ensure better results. These interactions between tools are usually carried out at the user level and it is not supported by the tools. In this work we present HeteroGenius, a framework conceived to develop tools that allow users to perform hybrid analysis of heterogeneous software specifications. HeteroGenius was designed prioritising the possibility of adding new specification languages and analysis tools and enabling a synergic relation of the techniques under a graphical interface satisfying several well-known usability enhancement criteria.

This has led to technological features and products that are not sharable across research teams, thereby limiting collaboration, reducing the speed of dissemination, and raising the bar for entry into this area of research. This paper provides an overview of Purple, an extensible, modular, and repurposable system created for the development of Web-based and mobile-based applications for health behavior change. Purple contains features required to construct applications and to manage and evaluate research trials using these applications. Core functionality of Purple includes elements that support user management, content authorship, content delivery, and data management. We discuss the history and development of the Purple system guided by the rationale of producing a system that allows greater collaboration and understanding across research teams interested in investigating similar questions and using similar methods. Purple provides a useful tool to meet the needs of stakeholders involved in the creation, provision, and usage of eHealth and mHealth applications. Housed in a non-profit, academic institution, Purple also offers the potential to facilitate the diffusion of knowledge across the research community and improve our capacity to deliver useful and usable applications that support the behavior change of end users.","Evaluation methodology; Internet intervention; Mobile health; Mobile intervention; Open source; Software engineering; Software tools","health behavior; health promotion; human; Internet; mobile application; procedures; telemedicine; Health Behavior; Health Promotion; Humans; Internet; Mobile Applications; Telemedicine",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84906282176

Often these organisations do not have comprehensive understanding of the new market due to inadequate market research. To design and develop a new software application, software engineers elicit requirements, ideally from end users, but the end users and stakeholders are often unavailable. User-Centred Design (UCD) is a methodology used to develop applications that consider the goals of the users as a primary requirement. Personas, archetypical users, and scenarios, the interaction of personas with the application to achieve goals, are tools used within UCD methodology. Software engineers can deduce the application requirements from personas and scenarios. Hence the closer the persona represents the end user, the more usable the resultant software application will become. Holistic Persona, a persona with five dimensions: factual, personality, intelligence, knowledge and cognitive process, seeks to more closely resemble the end user. Reflection-inaction, reflection on the spontaneous thinking that is happening during a task, Reflection-on-action, reflection after the task is over, Reflection-for-action, reflection done to gain knowledge for a similar future task, enhances the skills of software engineers while designing a new software application. Reflective capacity is regarded by many as an essential characteristic for professional competence. In this paper we explore the research question: how can software engineers apply UCD methodologies and reflective concepts in designing and developing new software applications? Through two case studies, we provide insights into the applications of UCD methodologies and reflective concepts in software engineering for development of a new application. We present our experiences during design and development of the applications and lessons learnt from the projects. We speculate how Holistic Personas and scenarios would have resulted in speedier development and improvements in the quality of the end products. Case one is about engineering an idea into an e-health software application at a research-intensive Australian university. Case two is about engineering a system and an application to provide automated program guide, news, sport highlights, short feature films and weather published on an Australian national broadcasting services' website for the multi-channel digital television system. Both applications were green-field developments with no past histories of a similar application to model for their design and development. © The Authors, 2014.

In that way, whatever the sector is, workers carrying out maintenance activities are exposed to various hazards (e.g. chemical, physical, biological or psychosocial) that may be at risk of developing musculoskeletal disorders, diseases, etc. and occupational accidents (e.g. falls through or off something). Indeed maintenance can affect the health and safety not only of the workers directly involved in it, but of other people present in the workplace. To face this maintenance risk issue, risk assessment/management approaches are conventionally conducted by considering human, organisational or technical directions. Nevertheless such approaches are often not enough efficient because too focused on one direction without taking into account all its interactions with the others. Thus this paper presents a generic integrated risk management approach to maintenance which is based on a generic formalisation of maintenance (intervention) business processes/activities but also of their requirements more dedicated to health and safety. Then the approach and its resulting models have been automated on a tool called SPRIMI (software engineering) to be usable for information, support, training and design of safe maintenance system. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Occupational safety; Process approach; Risk management; Safe maintenance; SPRIMI software","Accidents; Chemical hazards; Occupational risks; Risk management; Software prototyping; Integrated risk management; Maintenance activity; Maintenance operations; Musculoskeletal disorders; Occupational accident; Occupational safety; Process approach; Technical Directions; Maintenance; Risk management; accident prevention; article; computer program; methodology; occupational exposure; occupational hazard; occupational health; occupational safety; priority journal; risk management; SPRIMI software; validation process; worker; workplace; accuracy; Article; automation; health hazard; human; mathematical model; occupational hazard; organizational downsizing; organizational efficiency; outcome assessment; policy; process development; risk assessment; risk factor; risk management; risk reduction",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84901978642

It is a method of assisting in clinical decision making by using the most relevant research evidence to answer clinical questions. Complete Blood Count (CBC) is one of the most commonly ordered blood test that could be done within minutes and is mostly used as a basis for further testing. Therefore, CBC could be used as a base to quickly diagnose a patient and later on, use external clinical evidence from systematic research to further diagnose the patient. This paper proposes the development of a clinical decision support system (CDSS) to assist physicians in evidence based practice. The system will be able to provide the list of external evidence (electronic medical journals) for each type of generated probable disease. Usability and user acceptance testing were conducted with a group of physicians and medical students.

Information technology plays a key role in communicating and disseminating the patient's clinical data [1]. The Sana Mobile, originally developed by MIT (the Massachusetts Institute of Technology) for mobile platform, consists of an open source electronic medical record. It has revolutionized the delivery of healthcare services in remote areas in a clear and objective way [2]. The mobile device stores Sana medical data, text files, audio and video containing patient's clinical information while transmitting data over the mobile platform to a web server, the Open Medical Record System - OpenMRS. This system gathers information about medications, diagnoses, and others crucial data from a patient, making them available to consultations by many medical experts. Our tests with Sana Mobile - OpenMRS focus on the development of an experimental extension of this mobile platform and its use in supporting education and training of medical students encompassing routine free ambulatory care and multidisciplinary research project.

These researchers would greatly benefit from meta-composite software development or the ability to continuously compose and recompose tools together in response to their ever-changing needs. However, the available tools are largely disconnected, and current software approaches are inefficient and ineffective in their support for meta-composite software development. Building on the composite services development approach, the de facto standard for developing integrated software systems, we propose a concept-map and agent-based meta-composite software development approach. A crucial step in composite services development is the modeling of users' needs as processes, which can then be specified in an executable format for system composition. We have two key innovations. First, our approach allows researchers (who understand their needs best) instead of technicians to take a leadership role in the development of process models, reducing inefficiencies and errors. A second innovation is that our approach also allows for modeling of complex user interactions as part of the process, overcoming the technical limitations of current tools. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach using a real-world translational research use case. We also present results of usability studies evaluating our approach for future refinements. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Data integration; Informatics; Meta-composite; Systems integration; Translational research","article; computer program; genetic linkage; leadership; medical informatics; process model; system analysis; translational research; computer interface; human; software; theoretical model; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Software; Translational Medical Research; User-Computer Interface",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84874937017

Software has become ubiquitous in healthcare applications, as is evident from its prevalent use for controlling medical devices, maintaining electronic patient health data, and enabling healthcare information technology (HIT) systems. As the software functionality becomes more intricate, concerns arise regarding efficacy, safety and reliability. It thus becomes imperative to adopt an approach or methodology based on best engineering practices to ensure that the possibility of any defect or malfunction in these devices is minimized. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Healthcare Systems; Human Factors; Interoperability; Medical Software; Risk Management; Safety Standards; Security and Privacy; Software Development; Usability","Health-care system; Medical software; Safety standard; Security and privacy; Usability; Biomedical equipment; Electrocardiography; Health care; Human engineering; Information technology; Internet; Interoperability; Laser surgery; Pacemakers; Patient monitoring; Risk management; Software engineering; Software reliability",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84872762369

It is a generic template which is independent of usability evaluation methods and provides flexibility for adaptation in different contexts and domains. In this paper, a usability model for medical user interfaces, especially for ventilator systems in Intensive Care Unit (ICU), is proposed based on Norman’s action-oriented seven-step model to capture a related medical context. A ventilator system is a therapeutic device, which provides a respiratory support to critically-ill patients. Currently, a usability of user interfaces of ventilator systems is evaluated by typical usability evaluation methods from software industry. These evaluation methods miss out important elements in medical context. Therefore, a need for a specialized usability model for medical user interfaces is fulfilled with a proposed usability model encompassing vital elements such as medical user, user interface, ICU environment and time required. This usability model is validated first, through a human work analysis using videos of selected tasks with medical user interfaces and then, with an overview of critical factors affecting medical user interfaces in ICU. In future, a proposed usability model can be integrated with a suitable usability evaluation method for evaluating medical user interfaces to identify related medical usability problems more effectively. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2013.","Human work analysis; Intensive care unit; Medical user interface; Usability evaluation; Usability model; Ventilator system; Video analysis","Intensive care units; Medical problems; Software engineering; Usability engineering; Medical user interfaces; Usability evaluation; Usability modeling; Ventilator systems; Video analysis; Work analysis; User interfaces",Conference Paper,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84952033620

A panel of interdisciplinary experts (the authors) was convened by the National Institute of Standards and Technology to generate consensus recommendations to improve EHR usefulness, usability, and patient safety when supporting pediatric care, with a focus on critical user interactions. Methods: The panel members represented expertise in the disciplines of human factors engineering (HFE), usability, informatics, and pediatrics in ambulatory care and pediatric intensive care. An iterative, scenario-based approach was used to identify unique considerations in pediatric care and relevant human factors concepts. A draft of the recommendations were reviewed by invited experts in pediatric informatics, emergency medicine, neonatology, pediatrics, HFE, nursing, usability engineering, and software development and implementation. Recommendations: Recommendations for EHR developers, small-group pediatric medical practices, and children's hospitals were identified out of the original 54 recommendations, in terms of nine critical user interaction categories: patient identification, medications, alerts, growth chart, vaccinations, labs, newborn care, privacy, and radiology. Conclusion: Pediatric patient care has unique dimensions, with great complexity and high stakes for adverse events. The recommendations are anticipated to increase the rate of EHR adoption by pediatric care providers and improve patient safety for pediatric patients. The described methodology might be useful for accelerating adoption and increasing safety in a variety of clinical areas where the adoption of EHRs is lagging or usability issues are believed to reduce potential patient safety, efficiency, and quality benefits.

ISO 14971 provides a framework and taxonomy for medical device risk management process but does not provide details or explanations of its requirements. The IEC 60601 standard family for medical electrical equipment defines the major hazards as an input for the Risk Management Process. Further process standards deal with software and use-related risks in particular (IEC 62304, ISO 62366). It is a challenging task to fulfil all these requirements in one integrated process and provide a comprehensive documentation (Risk Management File) to achieve compliance. We have set up a Risk Management (RM) process for our two different active medical devices. We will share our implementation which handles the Hardware, Software and Use Risk in an integrated way on the functional level. Further particular software-related RM tasks are handled in the software development life-cycle separately. Additionally, we will present our tool chain, which provides evidence of carrying out RM tasks throughout the whole development life-cycle, including connections to the requirement management and effectiveness verification. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.","medical software development; risk management; usability engineering","Biomedical equipment; Software design; Usability engineering; Comprehensive documentation; Electrical equipment; Integrated risk management; Multiple standards; Regulatory environment; Requirement management; Risk management process; Software development life cycle; Risk management",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84904605952

As part of a larger research effort, this poster presents the design, implementation and initial testing of a mobile application aimed at helping the child-to-adult-care transition process for children with chronic disease. Based on recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics, the application will help guide patients through four main components of transition: 1. assess transition readiness; 2. plan the transition; 3. implement the transition; and, 4. help document the transition. The design, implementation and testing of a mobile application may ease the transition process. By leveraging modern cross-compilation tools, this application can be implemented on multiple mobile platforms.

There is a major effort in this rapidly evolving field of research to develop the algorithmic tools necessary to cope with the complexity of the datasets. Objectives: This work illustrates our strategy that encompasses the development of a modularized and open software tool for data processing, visualization and interactive exploration in diffusion imaging research and aims at reinforcing sustainable evaluation and progress in the field. Methods: In this paper, the usability and capabilities of a new application and toolkit component of the Medical Imaging and Interaction Toolkit (MITK, www.mitk.org), MITKDI, are demonstrated using in-vivo datasets. Results: MITK-DI provides a comprehensive software framework for high-performance data processing, analysis and interactive data exploration, which is designed in a modular, extensible fashion (using CTK) and in adherence to widely accepted coding standards (e.g. ITK, VTK). MITK-DI is available both as an open source software development toolkit and as a ready-to-use in stallable application. Conclusions: The open source release of the modular MITK-DI tools will increase verifiability and comparability within the research community and will also be an important step towards bringing many of the current techniques towards clinical application. © Schattauer 2012.","Common toolkit CTK; Diffusion tensor imaging; Open-source software toolkit; Q-ball imaging; Tractography","algorithm; article; brain; computer assisted diagnosis; computer program; diffusion tensor imaging; histology; human; methodology; standard; Algorithms; Brain; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Software",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84870925422

Software-based systems are more and more developed by reusable components available as commercial off-the-shelf components or open source components. The successful introduction of such integrated systems into businesses however does depend whether we trust the system or not. Trust and therewith the quality of software-based systems is determined by many properties such as completeness, consistency, maintainability, security, safety, reliability, and usability, among others. However during the development of software-based systems there are many opportunities to introduce errors in the different phases of the software development lifecycle. Testing is commonly applied as the predominant activity in industry to ensure high software quality providing a wide variety of methods and techniques to detect different types of errors in software-based systems. The panel goal is to discuss software testing strategy and techniques to improve the quality of the software and at the same time to build trust with customers. The panel will discuss the experts view on what the key factors are in developing high quality software-based systems. Through the panel, the discussions shall include the impact of testing on software quality within several domains and their businesses. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Automotive domains; Commercial off-the-shelf components; Daily lives; High quality; Integrated systems; Open-source components; Reusable components; Software control systems; Software development life cycle; Software Quality; Software-based; Computer software selection and evaluation; Embedded software; Errors; Software testing; Open systems",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84870793047

Furthermore, the need for mobility has introduced unique constraints such as context, connectivity, size and data entry methods that impact on the apps' usability. These constraints can create usability errors that could increase risk levels especially in contexts like finance, health, or road navigation. The desire of Enterprises to embed their mobile apps' development into their business cycle increases the need to have a specialized software development process. Although many agile methods have been introduced over the last decade, none of methods has focused on reducing usability errors. This paper proposes a novel Mobile Development Process Spiral which is a Usability-Driven-Model. The process is designed to integrate usability into existing application development processes and recommends usability techniques for assessing mobile apps. © 2012 IEEE.","mobile software development; spiral model; usability; user center design","Agile methods; Application development process; Business cycles; Development process; In contexts; Mobile apps; Mobile Technology; Risk levels; Specialized software; Spiral models; usability; Usability techniques; User-center designs; Errors; Health risks; Software engineering; Usability engineering",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84874042574

Many tools support the BIM process, or at least they claim. BIM not only offers opportunities for the Architectural Engineering and Construction industry, but also for the client. In this paper we don't focus on the professional client, but on the client of a building assignment that act as the end-user. Involvement of the end user in the design process has been advocated by many scholars and designers, but has so far only marginally been adopted in practice. The importance of user participation is demonstrated by the lack of success of smart technologies in new housing or in renovation. Particularly elderly people resist accepting these technologies in their home environment, although they could benefit from these technologies to improve comfort and health care. As a result of poor understanding of these new technologies by both designers and end users, researchers observe that there is a mismatch between user demands and smart technology usability. Hence, this paper is an attempt to improve the role of users in the design process in two ways. Firstly, by adding the missing components of smart technology to current BIM model libraries. Secondly, by developing a virtual model in which users can interact with the smart technologies and configure their preferred layout. The final results are interesting not only for technology developers but also for housing designers who aim at improving the quality of life in future housing for aging society. Method: For a better understanding of BIM, a historical perspective is taken in this paper. The initiatives from different research institutes are discussed and how they affected each other. The up-take by the software industry is highlighted and their delicate relationship with science. In today's design process BIM systems support spatial design that is accommodate by smart technology. Usually this smart technology is added after the spatial design in the final design stage by the installations expert. In our research we want to turn this process around; the smart technologies are accommodated by spatial design. Therefore we develop a design system with a library of smart components such as smart wall, smart kitchen and smart furniture. The difference between smart technologies and standard building components is that smart technologies interact with the building users. BIM allows for realistic visualization of designs in an early stage. In our prototype system, clients are presented a virtual space with a wide range of smart technologies. After being introduced to these technologies, the client expresses how these will fit within his/her activities. Following he/she can experience in the virtual model how smart technologies react when activities are executed. Results & Discussion: A prototype system is presented that allows clients such as elderly to experience smart technologies. In contrast with traditional design it does not start from the spatial layout but from the activities that should be accommodated supported by smart technologies. We expect that fundamentally different layout will emerge from this approach. Although no experimental data are available yet, some first experiences will be discussed.","BIM; Client support; Smart technology","Architectural engineering; BIM; Building Information Model - BIM; Historical perspective; International researches; Research institutes; Smart technology; User participation; Construction industry; Housing; Research; Robotics; Software engineering; Structural design; Technology; Architectural design",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84893256468

With every lift they put themselves at risk of injury. Many still-frame modeling systems exist that can assess the different stresses and strains on the laborers body given his or her position. These models are only usable by experts, and do not allow for real-time alerts. In 1995, companies in the United States lost $50 billion due to injured employee absences and compensation settlements. Companies are not only eager to reduce their overhead costs, but also aim to better society by offering more robust worker safety practices. The focus of this project was to design a system that can be used in a training environment. Our system is used to teach employees if their current lifting and carrying methods can be detrimental to their health. Our system is designed to be used for longstanding employees as well as new hires. This project's primary requirement was to implement a motion sensing device to aid in the analysis of ergonomics in an industrial environment. To do this we proposed to make use of Microsoft Kinect© sensors. The Kinect© is able to provide skeletal tracking at 30 frames/second for two individuals in the field of view. To develop the system we selected the Microsoft software development kit (SDK) from a large variety of alternative professional and open source SDKs because of a variety of desirable features. A static ergonomic model was integrated with the Kinect© software. Multiple other software packages were assessed for compatibility with the Kinect© in an effort to enhance the Kinects'O ability to recognize objects and humans. After development was complete the system was tested by analyzing our system's output using different skeletal lift positions to compare to the real results. Our system provides real-time ergonomic analysis of lifts performed by humans. This system lacks the ability to recognize specific individuals and objects necessary to customize the system to adequately evaluate a lift, and has not been tested in a factory environment. In the future we hope to implement a dynamic ergonomic model so that it can recognize whole movements or gestures which lead to injury, rather than recognizing a single position.

The development and usability testing of iCare v.1.0 followed a rapid prototyping software development and testing model. Once the functionality was tested by engineers, the usability and feasibility testing began with a convenience sample of focus group members including undergraduate and graduate students and faculty. Three focus groups were created, and four subjectsparticipated in each focus group (n = 12). Nielsen's usability heuristics and methods of evaluation were used to evaluate data captured from each focus group. Overall, users wanted a full-featured electronic health record with features that coached or guided users. The earliest versions of iCare v.1.0 did not provide help features and prompts to guide students but were later added. Future versions will incorporate a full-featured help section. The interface and design of iCare v.1.0 are similar to professional electronic health record applications. As a result of this usability study, future versions of iCare will include more robust help features along with advanced reporting and elements specific to specialty populations such as pediatrics and mental health services.

It is often the first step in checking for basic information about a disease and its treatment. The search results are often useful to general users. Various search engines such as Google, Yahoo!, Bing, and Ask.com can play an important role in obtaining medical information for both medical professionals and lay people. However, the usability and effectiveness of various search engines for medical information have not been comprehensively compared and evaluated. Objective: To compare major Internet search engines in their usability of obtaining medical and health information. Methods: We applied usability testing as a software engineering technique and a standard industry practice to compare the four major search engines (Google, Yahoo!, Bing, and Ask.com) in obtaining health and medical information. For this purpose, we searched the keyword breast cancer in Google, Yahoo!, Bing, and Ask.com and saved the results of the top 200 links from each search engine. We combined nonredundant links from the four search engines and gave them to volunteer users in an alphabetical order. The volunteer users evaluated the websites and scored each website from 0 to 10 (lowest to highest) based on the usefulness of the content relevant to breast cancer. A medical expert identified six well-known websites related to breast cancer in advance as standards. We also used five keywords associated with breast cancer defined in the latest release of Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine-Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) and analyzed their occurrence in the websites. Results: Each search engine provided rich information related to breast cancer in the search results. All six standard websites were among the top 30 in search results of all four search engines. Google had the best search validity (in terms of whether a website could be opened), followed by Bing, Ask.com, and Yahoo!. The search results highly overlapped between the search engines, and the overlap between any two search engines was about half or more. On the other hand, each search engine emphasized various types of content differently. In terms of user satisfaction analysis, volunteer users scored Bing the highest for its usefulness, followed by Yahoo!, Google, and Ask.com. Conclusions: Google, Yahoo!, Bing, and Ask.com are by and large effective search engines for helping lay users get health and medical information. Nevertheless, the current ranking methods have some pitfalls and there is room for improvement to help users get more accurate and useful information. We suggest that search engine users explore multiple search engines to search different types of health information and medical knowledge for their own needs and get a professional consultation if necessary. © Liupu Wang, Juexin Wang, Michael Wang, Yong Li, Yanchun Liang, Dong Xu.","Ask.com; Bing; Breast cancer; Google; Hallway testing; Health information seeking; Internet search; Medical information; Page rank; SNOMED CT; Software engineering; Usability testing; User experience evaluation; Yahoo!","article; comparative study; computer program; information retrieval; Internet; medical informatics; Information Storage and Retrieval; Internet; Medical Informatics; Software",Conference Paper,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864201535

The approach uses ontologies to create not merely a class hierarchy for a vocabulary but a full formal representation and, further, takes advantage of reasoning with description logic to provide application behaviour. The ontologies support a disjoint representation of graphical features and their interpretation in terms of medical findings. This separation of image features and medical findings allows the representation of different conceptual interpretations of the same graphical object, allowing different opinions of radiologists to be used in reasoning, which makes the approach useful for describing images to be used in computer-based learning and other applications. Three applications are discussed in detail: assessment of overlap in annotations, a conceptual consistency check in radiology training, and modelling temporal changes in parenchymal patterns. Reasoner usage, software testing, and implementation in Java are presented. The results show that, despite performance problems using the current implementations of reasoners, the description logic approach can be useful in practical applications. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","clinical terminology; computer-based learning; description logic; knowledge representation; mammography; ontology","Class hierarchies; Clinical terminology; Computer-based learning; Conceptual consistency; description logic; Formal representations; Graphical features; Graphical objects; Image features; Mammographic; Other applications; Parenchymal patterns; Performance problems; Reasoner; Temporal change; Artificial intelligence; Data description; E-learning; Formal languages; Health care; Mammography; Medical imaging; Ontology; Radiology; Software engineering; Software testing; Terminology; Knowledge representation",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857770568

We designed and implemented a prototype software tool to provide information about hypertension, video instructions on correct home blood pressure measurement technique and a measurements diary. The system was developed using standard, software development methods and techniques. The program was developed for Danishspeaking patients. Usability (navigability, level and outcome of instructions, logical arrangement, level and focus of information, and program accessibility) was evaluated in a think-aloud test with test users performing specific, realistic tasks. The prototype provides written information about hypertension, written and video instructions on correct blood pressure measurement technique, and measurements diary functionality. All test users performed all tasks and rated navigability, level and outcome of instructions, logical arrangement, level and focus of information, and program accessibility high, and had positive attitudes towards the system. The components in the patient support tool can be used separately or in combination.

This challenge can be addressed by a web-accessible and flexible patient data capture system that is supported by a common terminological system to facilitate data re-usability, sharing, and integration. We present OPIC, an Ontology-driven Patient Information Capture (OPIC) system that uses a domain-specific epilepsy and seizure ontology (EpSO) to (1) support structured entry of multi-modal epilepsy data, (2) proactively ensure quality of data through use of ontology terms in drop-down menus, and (3) identify and index clinically relevant ontology terms in free-text fields to improve accuracy of subsequent analytical queries (e.g. cohort identification). EpSO, modeled using the Web Ontology Language (OWL), conforms to the recommendations of the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification and terminological commission. OPIC has been developed using agile software engineering methodology for rapid development cycles in close collaboration with domain expert and end users. We report the result from the initial deployment of OPIC at the University Hospitals Case Medical Center (UH CMC) epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) as part of the NIH-funded project on Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP). Preliminary user evaluation shows that OPIC has achieved its design objectives to be an intuitive patient information capturing system that also reduces the potential for data entry errors and variability in use of epilepsy terms.",,"article; classification; computer interface; computer program; electronic medical record; epilepsy; human; information retrieval; Internet; linguistics; seizure; Epilepsy; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval; Internet; Medical Records Systems, Computerized; Seizures; Software; User-Computer Interface; Vocabulary, Controlled",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84880778134

To assist patients with CVDs in recovering from cardiac events and mediating cardiac risk factors, a home based cardiac rehabilitation program, known as the Care Assessment Platform (CAP), was developed. In the CAP program, patients are required to manually enter health information into their mobile phones on a daily basis. The manual operation is often subject to human errors and is inconvenient for some elderly patients. To improve this, an automated wireless solution has been desired. The objectives of this paper are to investigate the feasibility of implementing the newly released Bluetooth 4.0 (BT4.0) for the CAP program, and practically evaluate BT4.0 communications between a developed mobile application and some emulated healthcare devices. The study demonstrated that BT4.0 addresses usability, interoperability and security for healthcare applications, reduces the power consumption in wireless communication, and improves the flexibility of interface for software development. This evaluation study provides an essential mobile BT4.0 framework to incorporate a large range of healthcare devices for clinical assessment and intervention in the CAP program, and hence it is useful for similar development and research work of other mobile healthcare solutions. © 2012 The authors and IOS Press.

Our team work with a health care software developed by people from computer science and physiotherapy, without people related to usability. After various functions developed, the users continuously claim for easier ways to use the software, and we detect some learnability problems.

The results show that is possible to reach a satisfactory amount of problems to correct, great feedback from users, similar results between heuristic evaluation and usability tests with users and that even people with few knowledge about usability can learn and conduct tests like ones of the Usability Engineering. Additionally, these methods can be integrated in our software life cycle, what will avoid future re-work.","Discount usability; Health careWeb applications; Usability","Discount usability; Heuristic evaluation; Interactive system; Software development life cycle; Software development teams; Software life cycles; Usability; Usability techniques; Application programs; Health care; Information systems; Life cycle; Software design; User interfaces; Wireless telecommunication systems; Usability engineering",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84890525714

Health care providers do not routinely refer smokers to these interventions. Objective: The objective of our study was to uncover barriers and facilitators to the use of an e-referral system that will be evaluated in a community-based randomized trial. The e-referral system will allow providers to refer smokers to an online smoking intervention during routine clinical care. Methods: We devised a four-step development and pilot testing process: (1) system conceptualization using Delphi to identify key functionalities that would overcome barriers in provider referrals for smoking cessation, (2) Web system programming using agile software development and best programming practices with usability refinement using think-aloud testing, (3) implementation planning using the nominal group technique for the effective integration of the system into the workflow of practices, and (4) pilot testing to identify practice recruitment and system-use barriers in real-world settings. Results: Our Delphi process (step 1) conceptualized three key e-referral functions: (1) Refer Your Smokers, allowing providers to e-refer patients at the point of care by entering their emails directly into the system, (2) practice reports, providing feedback regarding referrals and impact of smoking-cessation counseling, and (3) secure messaging, facilitating provider-patient communication. Usability testing (step 2) suggested the system was easy to use, but implementation planning (step 3) suggested several important approaches to encourage use (eg, proactive email cues to encourage practices to participate). Pilot testing (step 4) in 5 practices had limited success, with only 2 patients referred; we uncovered important recruitment and system-use barriers (eg, lack of study champion, training, and motivation, registration difficulties, and forgetting to refer). Conclusions: Implementing a system to be used in a clinical setting is complex, as several issues can affect system use. In our ongoing large randomized trial, preliminary analysis with the first 50 practices using the system for 3 months demonstrated that our rigorous preimplementation evaluation helped us successfully identify and overcome these barriers before the main trial. © Rajani S Sadasivam, Kathryn Delaugther, Katie Crenshaw, Heather J Sobko, Jessica H Williams, Heather L Coley, Midge N Ray, Daniel E Ford, Jeroan J Allison, Thomas K Houston.","Family practice; General practice; Health services research; Public health informatics; Randomized controlled trial; Smoking cessation; User interfaces; Web-based services","article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; Delphi study; health care personnel; hospital information system; human relation; Internet; methodology; patient referral; pilot study; randomized controlled trial; smoking cessation; statistics; Delphi Technique; Health Personnel; Internet; Pilot Projects; Point-of-Care Systems; Professional-Patient Relations; Referral and Consultation; Smoking Cessation",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-81855217470

Extensive literature exists on the development of efficient algorithms for association mining computations, and the fundamental motivation for this literature is that association mining reveals actionable insights and enables better policies. This motivation is proven valid for domains such as retailing, healthcare and software engineering, where elements of the analyzed set are physical or virtual items that appear in transactions. However, the literature does not prove this motivation for databases where items are ""derived items"", rather than actual items. This study investigates the association patterns in changes of exchange rates of US Dollar, Euro and Gold in the Turkish economy, by representing the percentage changes as ""derived items"" that appear in ""derived market baskets"", the day on which the observations are made. The study is one of the few in literature that applies such a mapping and applies association mining in exchange rate analysis, and the first one that considers the Turkish case.

Automation has already been studied in a number of (sub-) disciplines and application fields: design, human factors, psychology, (software) engineering, aviation, health care, games. One distinguishing feature of the area we are focusing on is that in the field of interactive critical systems properties such as reliability, dependability and fault-tolerance are as important as usability or user experience. The SIG targets at two problem areas: first the engineering of the user interaction with (partly-) autonomous systems: how to design, build and assess autonomous behavior, especially in cases where there is a need to represent on the user interface both autonomous and interactive objects. An example of such integration is the representation of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) (where no direct interaction is possible), together with aircrafts (that have to be instructed by an air traffic controller to avoid the UAV). Second the design and engineering of user interaction in general for autonomous objects/systems (for example a cruise control in a car or an autopilot in an aircraft). The goal of the SIG is to raise interest in the CHI community on these aspects and to identify a community of researchers and practitioners interested in those more and more prominent issues of interfaces for interactive critical systems. The expected audience should be interested in addressing the issues of integration of mainly unconnected research domains to formulate a new joint research agenda.","Automation; Human error; Interactive systems engineering; Reliability; Safety critical systems; Usability","Air traffic controller; Application fields; Autonomous behaviors; Autonomous systems; Critical systems; Cruise control; Direct interactions; Engineering automation; Human error; Human factors; Interactive objects; Interactive systems engineering; Problem areas; Research agenda; Research domains; Safety critical systems; Usability; User experience; User interaction; Air traffic control; Aircraft control; Design; Fault tolerance; Health care; Human computer interaction; Human engineering; Research; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Unmanned vehicles; User interfaces; Automation",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79957960480

During the literature review, this article examines the potential relationship between mouse movement and musculoskeletal disorders of the upper extremity, based on studies from medical sciences. Subsequently, in the main part of the present study, three software products were selected that had at least one usability flaw related to extra mouse movement (the selection of the software was made out of over 20 software programs that had been evaluated in our Software Quality Assessment Laboratory). For these products, all additional mouse movements were measured, involving actual users in various settings and computer configurations. The findings showed that even a single usability flaw may increase mouse movement to a magnitude of between 3.6 and 4.7 m/h. The article concludes that the role of software engineering is to focus on software usability as well, taking into account that a user friendly graphical user interface (GUI) which is able to eliminate unnecessary mouse movement may also eventually contribute to the reduction of fatigue and discomfort, caused by musculoskeletal disorders. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","mouse movement; software usability; usability flaws","Computer configuration; Literature reviews; Medical science; Mouse movements; Musculoskeletal disorders; Side effect; Software products; Software program; Software quality assessment; software usability; Upper extremity; usability flaws; User friendly; Computer software selection and evaluation; Graphical user interfaces; Software engineering; Usability engineering",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79956074596

Some areas in Asia have no medical facilities and proper mental health care is unavailable. To cope with these problems, application of ICT for mental health services has been recognized as one of the effective approaches. Therefore, we have been studying and putting into practice online counseling for people assigned overseas. We constructed a system using agile software development for those assigned overseas in Asia. The first step involved developing a prototype system based on system requirements after we repeatedly discussed system development with people in charge of a clinic. Next, we conducted interviews about the online counseling system. We also discussed and analyzed the interviews. Finally, we completed the online Web counseling system by repeatedly discussing possible improvements with the clinic and then incorporating the changes in the system. Moreover, we evaluated the system by conducting a survey in the form of a questionnaire. Since we developed an effective online counseling system using statistical methods, this paper reports on the construction and usability evaluation of the system. © 2011 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.","Agile software development; Mental health care; Online Web counseling system; Usability evaluation; User-centered design",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858683273

The Fall TIPS application aims to prevent patient falls by translating routine nursing fall risk assessment into a decision support intervention that communicates fall risk status and creates a tailored evidence-based plan of care that is accessible to the care team, patients, and family members. In our design and implementation of the Fall TIPS toolkit, we used the Spiral Software Development Life Cycle model. Three output tools available to be generated from the toolkit are bed poster, plan of care, and patient education handout. A preliminary design of the application was based on initial requirements defined by project leaders and informed by focus groups with end users. Preliminary design partially simulated the paper version of the Morse Fall Scale currently used in hospitals involved in the research study. Strengths and weaknesses of the first prototype were identified by heuristic evaluation. Usability testing was performed at sites where research study is implemented. Suggestions mentioned by end users participating in usability studies were either directly incorporated into the toolkit and output tools, were slightly modified, or will be addressed during training. The next step is implementation of the fall prevention toolkit on the pilot testing units.

The paper summarizes FLOSS-related trends in health care as anticipated by members of the IMIA Open Source Working Group. Data were obtained through literature review and personal experience and observations of the authors in the last two decades. A status quo is given by a frequency analysis of the database of Medfloss.org, one of the world's largest platforms dedicated to FLOSS-HC. The authors discuss current problems in the field of health care and finally give a prospective roadmap, a projection of the potential influences of FLOSS in health care. FLOSS-HC already exists for more than 2 decades. Several projects have shown that FLOSS may produce highly competitive alternatives to proprietary solutions that are at least equivalent in usability and have a better total cost of ownership ratio. The Medfloss.org database currently lists 221 projects of diverse application types. FLOSS principles hold a great potential for addressing several of the most critical problems in health care IT. The authors argue that an ecosystem perspective is relevant and that FLOSS principles are best suited to create health IT systems that are able to evolve over time as medical knowledge, technologies, insights, workflows etc. continuously change. All these factors that inherently influence the development of health IT systems are changing at an ever growing pace. Traditional models of software engineering are not able to follow these changes and provide up-to-date systems for an acceptable cost/value ratio. To allow FLOSS to positively influence Health IT in the future a ""FLOSS-friendly"" environment has to be provided. Policy makers should resolve uncertainties in the legal framework that disfavor FLOSS. Certification procedures should be specified in a way that they do not raise additional barriers for FLOSS.",,"article; computer program; licensing; medical informatics; organization and management; Licensure; Medical Informatics; Medical Informatics Applications; Ownership; Software",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84886014473

Method: The study adheres to the usability principle that successful design accommodates complex problem solving. Requirements specifications, the application, and the application's code are examined as part of the study. Results: The first determination is that composing detailed narratives within the requirements specifications can ensure flexible spaces for users, in this case doctors, to view, study, and manipulate data as they see fit. The article also acknowledges and accounts for the reality of low-level or code-level procedural programming required for creating such flexible spaces. The second determination is that employing narratological structures within requirements specifications also leads to technical inventions at the code level. Practitioners will have a better understanding of how their work facilitates the development of a software application's functionality, design, and even code. Conclusion: Ultimately, narrative is the suggested method for developing the flexible affordances desired by usability specialists and it simultaneously helps negotiate low-level code.","Interface design; Narrative; Requirements specifications; Software development; Usability",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-77951584601

Despite these potential benefits, few healthcare organizations conduct systematic usability testing prior to software implementation. We used a Rapid Usability Evaluation (RUE) method to apply usability testing to software development at a major VA Medical Center. We describe the development of the RUE method, provide two examples of how it was successfully applied, and discuss key insights gained from this work. Clinical informaticists with limited usability training were able to apply RUE to improve software evaluation and elected to continue to use this technique. RUE methods are relatively simple, do not require advanced training or usability software, and should be easy to adopt. Other healthcare organizations may be able to implement RUE to improve software effectiveness, efficiency, and safety.",,"computer program; human; medical informatics; Humans; Medical Informatics; Software",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84964920883

In this approach, the implementation of such a complex IT solution is considered a major redesign of the work system. The paper describes the Human Factor (HF) tasks embedded in the project lifecycle: (1) analysis and modelling of the current work system and usability assessment of the medication CPOE solution; (2) HF recommendations for work re-design and usability recommendations for IT system re-engineering both aiming at a safer and more efficient work situation. Methods: Standard ethnographic methods were used to support the analysis of the current work system and work situations, coupled with cognitive task analysis methods and documents review. Usability inspection (heuristic evaluation) and both in-lab (simulated tasks) and on-site (real tasks) usability tests were performed for the evaluation of the CPOE candidate. Adapted software engineering models were used in combination with usual textual descriptions, tasks models and mock-ups to support the recommendations for work and product re-design. Results: The analysis of the work situations identified different work organisations and procedures across the hospital's departments. The most important differences concerned the doctor-nurse communications and cooperation modes and the procedures for preparing and administering the medications. The assessment of the medication CPOE functions uncovered a number of usability problems including severe ones leading to impossible to detect or to catch errors. Models of the actual and possible distribution of tasks and roles were used to support decision making in the work design process. The results of the usability assessment were translated into requirements to support the necessary re-engineering of the IT application. Conclusion: The HFE approach to medication CPOE efficiently identifies and distinguishes currently unsafe or uncomfortable work situations that could obviously benefit from an IT solution from other work situations incorporating efficient work procedures that might be impaired by the implementation of the CPOE. In this context, a careful redesign of the work situation and of the entire work system is necessary to actually benefit from the installation of the product in terms of patient safety and human performances. In parallel, a usability assessment of the product to be implemented is mandatory to identify potentially dangerous usability flaws and to fix them before the installation. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Unfortunately direct developers-users dialogues are not sufficient to ensure a proper understanding of the users' needs. It is also necessary to involve human factors specialists to analyze the users' expression of their needs and to properly formalize the requirements for design purposes. The objective of this paper is to present a case study reporting the collaborative work between HF experts and a company developing and commercializing a CPOE. This study shows how this collaboration helps resolve the limits of direct users involvement and usual problems pertaining to users' needs description and understanding. Method: The company participating in the study has implemented a procedure to convene regular meetings allowing direct exchanges between the development team and users' representatives. Those meetings aim at getting users' feedbacks on the existing products and at validating further developments. In parallel with usual HF methods supporting the analysis of the work system (onsite observations followed by debriefing interviews) and the usability evaluation of the application (usability inspection and usability tests), HF experts took the opportunity of the meetings organized by the company to collect, re-interpret and re-formulate the needs expressed by the users. Results: The developers perceive the physicians' requirements concerning the display of the patient's list of medication as contradictory. In a previous meeting round the users had required a detailed view of the medication list against the synthesized existing one. Once this requirement satisfied, the users participating in the current meeting round require a synthesized view against the existing detailed one. The development team is unable to understand what they perceive as a reverse claim. Relying on a cognitive analysis of the physicians' decision making concerning the patient's treatment, the HF experts help re-formulate the physicians' cognitive needs in terms of synthesized/detailed display of the medication list depending on the stage of the decision making process. This led to an astute re-engineering of the application allowing the physicians to easily navigate back and forth between the synthesized and detailed views depending on the progress of their decision making. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that the integration of users' representatives in the software lifecycle is a good point for the end users. But it remains insufficient to resolve the complex usability problems of the system. Such solutions require the integration of HF expertise. Moreover, such an involvement of HF experts may generate benefits in terms of reduction of (i) the number of iterative developments and (ii) the users' training costs. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Nevertheless, the building sector is particularly under pressure. Indeed, it is one of the biggest consumers of energy, either directly for lighting and thermal comfort (heating and air conditioning) or indirectly for the production of building materials. It also largely contributes to the massive use of some critical resources (such as energy, water, materials and space) and is responsible for a large portion of greenhouse gas emissions (Ratti et al. 2005). At the same time, the construction sector is expected, more than ever, to provide better living and working conditions: accessible and comfortable for all, safe and secure, durably enjoyable, efficient and flexible to changing demands, available and affordable. Current business models and working methods have reached their limits, and there is an urgent need for creativity-enhancing tools that support an 'out-of-the-box' approach to design, aiming for: • environmentally sustainable construction (in a context of limited resources - energy, water, materials and space); • meeting clients' and citizens' needs in terms of health (from indoor and outdoor exposures), security (against natural and industrial hazards), accessibility and usability for all (including the disabled and elderly), and enhanced life quality in buildings and urban environments. In that context, the chapter explores the possibilities of using geospatial information as input data to construct 3D models of the built environment. The models are then combined with simulations in order to address sustainable urban development issues within the planning process. Special focus will be given to 1) minimizing energy consumption and 2) simulation of air quality, taking into account meteorological data and traffic conditions. Finally, it is now commonly agreed that research must not be concerned solely with technology, as social, organisational and human issues also need to be considered in an interdisciplinary manner (Soubra et al. 2006). New working methods need to emerge in order to move away from the current situation where different groups or departments involved in urban planning (e.g. city planning, the legal office, the environment office, the roads department, the green department, etc.) sometimes work on the same project without communicating or, even worse, while hiding crucial information from each other. The chapter will report on how these aspects have been tackled by considering two test cities in Europe. © 2009 Editorial Matter - Geoffrey Qiping Shen, Peter Brandon and Andrew Baldwin.

Analysis, design, implementation and maintenance of such systems and intrinsic architectures have to follow a unified development methodology. Methods: The Generic Component Model (GCM) is used as a framework for modeling any system to evaluate and harmonize state of the art architecture development approaches and standards for health information systems as well as to derive a coherent architecture development framework for sustainable, semantically interoperable HIS and their components. The proposed methodology is based on the Rational Unified Process (RUP), taking advantage of its flexibility to be configured for integrating other architectural approaches such as Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), Model-Driven Architecture (MDA), ISO 10746, and HL7 Development Framework (HDF). Results: Existing architectural approaches have been analyzed, compared and finally harmonized towards an architecture development framework for advanced health information systems. Conclusion: Starting with the requirements for semantic interoperability derived from paradigm changes for health information systems, and supported in formal software process engineering methods, an appropriate development framework for semantically interoperable HIS has been provided. The usability of the framework has been exemplified in a public health scenario. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The software is developed by using Java technology and MySQL database system. A variety of vocal cues, e.g. Jitter and shimmer, that describe irregularities of speech cycles in sustained vowels can be automatically derived by the system. For assessing voice disorders in connected speech, a vocal cue called signal-to-dysperiodicity ratio is evaluated by carrying out a generalized variogram analysis. In the development, special attention has been paid to software engineering conventions and the principles of architectural design of software structures to achieve good quality attributes such as developmental simplicity and modifiability. Preliminary tests have shown that the system provides satisfactory usability and performance for clinical applications. © 2009 Firenze University Press.","Disordered voice analysis; Java application; Pathological voice assessment; Software engineering","Database systems; Java programming language; Medical applications; Quality management; Software engineering; Clinical application; Clinical workstations; Design and implementations; Design of softwares; Disordered voice analysis; Java applications; Pathological voice; Voice quality assessment; Application programs",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84908343225

It presents a bold challenge to the field of Computer Science. The goal of this study is to build a virtual human model for designing and evaluating visual privacy technologies before a security system is built. Given the available databases of anthropological models from CAESAR, 3D scanners and the physical parameters of human imaging systems, we simulate the scanning imagery data with the High Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS). The proportion and template matching algorithms have been developed to find the human surface features from 3D scanning data. The concealed object detection algorithms are developed according to the wave intensity and surface characteristics. Then the privacy-aware rendering methods are evaluated by usability studies. This forward-thinking approach intends to transform the development of visual privacy technologies from device-specific and proprietary to device-independent and open source. It also advances privacy research from an ad-hoc problem-solving process to a systematic design process, enabling multi-disciplinary innovations in digital human modeling, computer vision, information visualization, and computational aesthetics. The results of this study can be used in the privacy-aware imaging systems in airports and medical systems. They can also benefit the custom-fit products that are designed from personal 3D scanning data. Furthermore, our results can be used in the reconstruction of objects in digital archeology and medical imaging technologies such as virtual colonoscopy. © 2008 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.","3D scan; Feature recognition; Human body; Privacy; Security","Computer privacy; Computer vision; Digital image storage; Image processing; Imaging systems; Information systems; Medical imaging; Models; Optoelectronic devices; Scanning; Template matching; Three dimensional; Three dimensional computer graphics; Computer aided software engineering; Computer privacy; Data privacy; Imaging systems; Imaging techniques; Information systems; Medical imaging; Object detection; Problem solving; Scanning; Template matching; 3D scan; Feature recognition; Human body; Privacy; Security; Virtual reality; Virtual reality; 3-d scans; Concealed object detection; Feature recognition; High-frequency structure simulators; Human bodies; Medical imaging technology; Security; Template-matching algorithms",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-58049097960

Fortunately, the development of new standards like IEC/DIN EN 60601-1-6 is strengthening the focus on usability / user acceptance issues. This paper argues for the need to consider usability and user acceptance issues in early system development phases like the requirements engineering phase. In this paper, an empirically validated new quality model for user satisfaction is described first. The importance of the quality aspects included in this quality model for the medical domain is outlined. Then, the new quality model is used to develop a systematic methodology called Appraisal and Measurement of User Satisfaction (AMUSE), which allows gathering user acceptance information early in system development. The key activities of the AMUSE methodology and typical application scenarios are shown. Further on, the application of AMUSE, which was developed in close cooperation with Siemens Corporate Technology, is demonstrated in a real-world scenario at Siemens Audiologische Technik, a line of business of Siemens Medical Solutions. At the end, the first lessons learned from the application of the AMUSE methodology in this medical domain are discussed.

Yet, for millions of Americans with intellectual disabilities (ID), access to the benefits of cellphone technology is limited because of deficits in literacy, numerical comprehension, the proliferation of features and shrinking size of cellphone hardware and user interfaces. Developments in smart phone technology and PDA-based cellphones provide an opportunity to make the social and safety benefits of cellphones more independently accessible to this population. Method: This project involved employment of universal design and other specialised software development methods to create a multimedia cellphone interface prototype which was compared with a typical mainstream cellphone in a usability evaluation for individuals with ID. Participants completed a structured set of incoming/outgoing phone tasks using both the experimental and control conditions. Usability measurements included the amount of assistance needed and errors made in completing the cellphone use sequence. Results: A total of 22 individuals with ID participated in the research by engaging in a series of incoming and outgoing cellphone calls using both the multimedia cellphone prototype system and a mainstream Nokia 6360 cellphone. Test subjects required significantly less help (P = 0.001) and made significantly fewer errors (P < 0.001) when completing eight calls using the specialised multimedia phone system as compared with the mainstream phone. Conclusions: The statistical evidence of both usability results provide promising evidence of the feasibility of implementing universal design and other specialised software development methodologies for increasing independent access to the benefits of cellphone technologies for students and adults with ID. Issues related to designing cognitively accessible interfaces, study limitations and future directions are discussed. © Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Access; Cellphone; Intellectual disability; Multimedia","access to information; adult; aged; article; clinical article; cognition; computer aided design; computer interface; controlled study; feasibility study; female; health care access; human; information technology; intellectual impairment; male; mobile phone; multimedia; special education; Adolescent; Adult; Cellular Phone; Colorado; Computers, Handheld; Equipment Design; Feasibility Studies; Female; Humans; Intelligence; Male; Mental Retardation; Middle Aged; Software Design; User-Computer Interface; Young Adult",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-56649124451

Caring for the transplant patients in the hospital setting, right after the patient is moved from the intensive care unit to the ward, is one of the most challenging tasks in nursing. It involves many procedures, rigid protocols, tight monitoring, and intensive data gathering for use by the other coordinating healthcare professionals. The complexity is further increased when a nurse has to take care of several transplant patients in a single shift. Of late, there has been a growth of computer applications in nursing and clinical information systems. Their acceptability and usability determine the ultimate success of computer support for this complex task. In this paper, we present a case study in which we combine two well-known software engineering techniques-namely, agile programming and user centered design-toward the goal of developing an interactive system for supporting the activities of transplant nurses in a hospital setting. This has resulted in a usable end-product and the user centered approach has motivated the nurses to move towards the use of computers in their jobs for better productivity. The product's usability was formally evaluated and is reported herein. The strengths and limitations of this approach are also discussed. The software product developed has been well accepted and is currently being planned to replace the manual methods followed in the transplant ward of a large metropolitan hospital. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

A security meta-model has been developed in which the traditional role concept has been extended. The new concept incorporates the need of both security management as used by role-based access control (RBAC) and agent functional behaviour in agent-oriented Software Engineering (AOSE). Our approach avoids weaknesses of traditional RBAC approaches and provides a practically usable security model for Multi-agent Systems (MAS). A unified role interaction model framework has been put forward that incorporates not only functional requirements but also security constraints in MAS. A security policy rule scheme has been used to express security requirements in relation to affective roles. The major contribution of the work is that little redevelopment effort will be required when security is to be engineered into the overall MAS architecture, hence minimising the impact of the security requirements changes to the MAS architecture. We illustrate the approach through its potential application in a clinical trial setting involving a prototype medical decision support system, HealthAgents. © 2007 IEEE.",,"Adaptive systems; Decision support systems; Information management; Multi agent systems; Requirements engineering; Security of data; Adaptive security; Clinical trials environments; Security management; Data structures",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-37349048859

We propose a method for usability evaluation of use cases, a widely used representation of design ideas produced early in software development processes. The method proceeds by systematic inspection of use cases with reference to a set of guidelines for usable design. To validate the method, four evaluators inspected a set of use cases for a health care application. The usability problems predicted by the evaluators were compared to the result of a conventional think-aloud test. About one fourth of the problems were identified by both think-aloud testing and use case inspection; about half of the predicted problems not found by think-aloud testing were assessed as providing useful input to early development. Qualitative data on the evaluators' experience using the method are also presented. On this background, we argue that use case inspection has a promising potential and discuss its limitations. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2007.","Software development; Usability evaluation; Use cases","Computer aided design; Health care; Human computer interaction; Problem solving; Computer software; Human computer interaction; Inspection; Software engineering; Usability engineering; Qualitative data; Usability evaluation; Use cases; Software engineering; Software design; Development activity; Health care application; Qualitative data; Representation of designs; Software development process; Usability evaluation; Usability evaluation methods; Usability problems",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-38049114864

Failure of the software can have potentially catastrophic effects, leading to injury of patients or even death. It is therefore no surprise that regulators throughout the world are penalising medical device manufacturers that do not demonstrate that sufficient attention is devoted to the areas of hazard analysis and risk management (RM) throughout the software lifecycle. If a medical device company fails to comply with the regulations of a given country, in effect they surrender their legal right to market their device in that country. With so much at stake, it is in everybody's best interest that the medical device manufacturer gets it right. However, with so many different standards, regulatory guidance papers and industry guides on RM, the task of collating this information into a usable model is itself daunting. This paper seeks to extract the important concepts from a number of industry accepted standards and guides, and present them as a generic usable model for the medical device software industry. © 2006 ACM.","Capability maturity model integration (cmmi); Hazard analysis; Level of concern; Medical device software; Risk management; Software process improvement","Capability maturity model integration; Hazard analysis; Level of concern; Medical Devices; Software Process Improvement; Computer software selection and evaluation; Hazards; Industry; Laws and legislation; Risk management; Software engineering; Biomedical equipment",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84885576949

Selected images of the early phase were fused with selected images of the late phase by application of user-centered developed software. The image fusion was done in a semi-automatically way on a desktop computer (PC). The relationship between tumors and adjacent vessels was better visualized on the fused images than on the original source images.

In this paper we examine the utility of heuristic evaluation in improving the usability of a digital emergency medical services (EMS) system equipped on an ambulance. The digital EMS system used advanced communication technologies to help remotely located trauma specialists gain access to patient data in real-time and direct life-saving measures in a timely fashion. To improve its usability, three experts inspected prototypes of the system according to 14 software usability heuristics. The analyses revealed information on the prevalence, severity, and nature of heuristic violations in the user interface design. The results were subsequently utilized to guide the iterative software design process. A comparison between two consecutive prototypes showed that the second design had only half as many usability violations as the first prototype and had considerable improvement in a number of usability heuristic categories. The validity of heuristic evaluation was examined in an ethnographic study of paramedics using a prototype of the system in their work environment. Users' task performances partially verified heuristic evaluation results. However, they also revealed problems that were not identified in heuristic evaluation but only became prominent during field observation. In conclusion, we argue that usability should be given high priority in the development of a telemedicine system, and that heuristic evaluation can be an effective and efficient way to identify usability problems in the early stage of software development. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",,"Ambulance cars; Communication systems; Health care; Heuristic methods; Hospital data processing; Lifesaving equipment; Patient treatment; Real time systems; Remote control; Software prototyping; User interfaces; Digital emergency medical services (EMS); Ethnographic study; Heuristic violations; Paramedics; Telemedicine system; Telemedicine; ambulance; article; computer program; disease severity; emergency health service; ethnography; evaluation; health care system; medical specialist; prevalence; priority journal; technology; telemedicine; Ambulances; Emergency Medical Technicians; Humans; Software Design; Telemedicine; User-Computer Interface",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33644929501

It performs F0, noise and resonance frequencies tracking, on signal frames of varying length (even few ms), adaptively tailored to varying signal characteristics. Moreover, voiced/unvoiced separation is implemented, allowing disregarding unvoiced parts of the signal where misleading results could be obtained. Plots of F0 and its harmonics, noise tracking, spectrogram with resonance frequencies superimposed, are presented in a coloured-scale. Some added statistics allow further understanding and comparison of results. The new software tool is completely automatic, working with any sampling frequency and F0, and also with strongly corrupted signals, and does not need any manual setting of whatever option to be made by the user, thus being easily usable also by non-experts.

Privacy requirements are those that capture privacy goals and its associated measures for a system under development. In order to ensure privacy we must identify these elements. However, there are many challenges in their identification. For example, privacy requirements may be difficult to quantify and precisely specify. There is a need for systematic approaches for reasoning, modeling and analyzing privacy from the early stages of the software development. Furthermore, it is necessary to develop a usable ontology or classification of measurable aspects of privacy that can be used to aid in the specification of privacy requirements. These ontologies should be represented in a way that facilitates their use as guidelines for the requirements elicitation process. This work builds on a review of privacy legislation to develop a catalog of aspects of privacy that can be considered during requirements gathering. This catalogue is used to guide the requirements engineer through alternatives for achieving privacy. The approach uses the i* framework to model privacy as a special type of goal. We show how privacy can be modelled through different viewpoints with different alternatives for its operationalization.

Software development tools are programs that help developers create other programs and automate mundane operations while bringing the level of abstraction closer to the application engineer. In practice, software development tools have been in wide use among safety-critical system developers. Typical application areas include space, aviation, automotive, nuclear, railroad, medical, and military. While their use is widespread in safety-critical systems, the tools do not always assure the safe behavior of their respective products. This study examines the assumptions, practices, and criteria for assessing software development tools for building safety-critical real-time systems.

The resulting system has been used for research in both basic biomedical and clinically applied settings. 3D Slicer is built on a set of powerful and widely used software components (Tcl/Tk, VTK, ITK) to which is added an application layer that makes the system usable by non-programmer end-users.

The limitation of PDA devices includes (1) small screen size, which limits text-based data entry, reporting and browsing; (2) limited storage space and slow processing, which requires effective and efficient coding generation; (3) security limitations and inadequate third party application support, which poses challenge for application development. The corresponding strategies addressing the above challenges are (1) providing check box, radio button, drop down list, text field, combo box based data entry and minimise text-based data entry, such as text area; (2) allocating as much as possible data storage, communication and computation tasks to the desktop system and minimise the function PDA component needs to handle, store data in file instead of database on PDA; (3) carefully selecting the device and implementation platform that supports development. To maximise the usability of PDA-based health application, the solution to be implemented on PDA ideally should be data management tasks with minimum text-based data entry and high frequency of recording. Challenges and solutions for software re-engineering from desktop system to PDA-based application is outlined based on one application developed for World Health Organisation. In this example, the complex task of communication among PDA-based application, desktop system and the existent desktop application EpiData is effectively handled through the utilisation of XML files. A dynamic tool 'Questionnaire Designer' provides a completely dynamic user interface generation tool that could easily be handled by end user. The design idea for this application sets up a model for mobile health application with adequate flexibility of handling changing data management needs of end users. © 2004 IEEE.",,"Data management; Data storage; Mobile health application; Software re-engineering; Data communication equipment; Data reduction; Database systems; Personal digital assistants; Security of data; Software engineering; Web browsers; Mobile telecommunication systems",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-18844414070

Although therapy robots have a strong potential in dealing with therapeutic and other medical applications, they have not been fully utilized in everyday therapy activities due to concerns over safety and the lack of friendly robot user/patient interaction models. From the viewpoint of software engineering, a user-centred design based on UML (Unified Modelling Language) has been known to be one of the best solutions to satisfy usability since the design process relies heavily on the analysis of users and their tasks to reach their goals. Therefore, a model-driven approach to interactive system design via UML for therapy robots is needed to make them usable in the real world. This paper proposes such approach and introduces a new graphical notation that describes user interface elements and the methods of connection with hardware/software objects. With the proposed abstract interaction models, prototyping interactive systems can be made faster and allows for their evaluation by users and system developers before implementation in order to improve usability from the perspectives of users and system developers.","Interaction models; Interactive systems; Model-driven design; Therapy robots; Unified modelling language (UML); Usability; User-centred design","Computer software; Mathematical models; Physical therapy; Robotics; Structural design; User interfaces; Interaction models; Interactive systems; Nodel-driven design; Therapy robots; Unified Modelling Language (UML); Usability; User-centred design; Interactive computer systems",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-3543123006

Usability is an essential quality in software, in particular in a work context where poor usability and other risk factors related to the software and computers may cause health problems. We have interviewed a number of software developers, usability people and users about their attitudes to and practices for integrating usability and users' health concerns in software development. The interviews were conducted in two Swedish organisations with in-house development of bespoke software. Our main conclusion is that several factors combine to push usability and occupational health matters aside, some of which are attitudes to usability and users' health issues, unclear responsibilities, poor support for user-centeredness and usability in software development models, ineffective user participation and usability and users' health being ignored or forgotten in decisions about the software, its use and its design. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

A framework is presented for considering evaluation in the context of software development processes, in particular, the systems development life cycle (SDLC). Variations on standard design methodologies are then discussed, including methods based on rapid development and continual evaluation of prototype systems. Usability testing is presented as a key method for conducting evaluations during iterative system development. The emergence of design methodologies, where evaluation is viewed as a central part of the development cycle is also discussed. Evaluation methodologies are then considered along a continuum, ranging from studies involving a high degree of experimental control to observational approaches. A full cycle approach to evaluation of health care systems is argued for, involving deployment of new methods across the SDLC. Implications for future work exploring the integration of design and evaluation processes in health informatics are discussed. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The extent of the list of features for the radiology workstation used to be one of the most significant factors for a Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) vendor's ability to sell the radiology workstation. Not anymore! The list of features and tools offered by a radiology workstation is now very much the same between the major players in the PACS market. How these features work together distinguishes different radiology workstations. Integration (with the PACS/Radiology Information System (RIS) systems, with the 3D tool, Reporting Tool etc.), usability (user specific preferences, advanced display protocols, smart activation of tools etc.) and efficiency (what is the output a radiologist can generate with the workstation) are now core factors for selecting a workstation. This paper discusses these new trends in radiology workstation design. We demonstrate the importance of the interaction between the PACS vendor (software engineers) and the customer (radiologists) during the radiology workstation design. We focus on iterative aspects of the workstation development, such as the presentation of early prototypes to as many representative users as possible during the software development cycle and present the results of a survey of 8 radiologists on designing a radiology workstation.","Code refactoring; DICOM; PACS; Radiology workstation design; Usability","Computer aided software engineering; Computer workstations; Image communication systems; Network protocols; Radiology; Radiology information systems (RIS); Medical computing",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036056309

The software needs to be repeatedly used and enjoyed by both the patients and the therapists. The challenges to writing software for use by such disparate groups are significant, and there is currently very little software that has been written specifically for this user group.

Recent innovations in human-computer interaction design address new methods for effective requirements gathering, such as Participatory Design and Contextual Inquiry. However, even when projects use these methods successfully to collect valid requirement descriptions, it remains a challenge to establish a process that makes direct use of those descriptions during software development. Valuable requirements information can be lost as it is reinterpreted during the development of functional specifications and the implementation of the proposed system. We describe the several steps we have taken to keep an ongoing and evolving understanding of user requirements under consideration by system designers and developers as they face the `real' (to them) requirements of adapting function to the constraints of computer platforms, project cost, and delivery schedule. The specific work reported here applies to the design of software for a clinical workstation used to review medical information. However, we believe the lessons we learned, maintaining the influence of user requirements throughout the development process, will apply in other practical system development situations.",,"Computer architecture; Computer workstations; Management information systems; Software engineering; Systems analysis; User interfaces; Clinical workstation software; Human computer interaction",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030674229

Furthermore, progress is often hampered by the lack of adequate software tools that allow research ideas to be rapidly accomplished, evaluated, and brought into routine. We developed an integrated software environment that is distinct because it, on the one hand, provides an applicationbuilder toolbox for medical diagnosis and therapy. And, on the other hand, it allows for the development, integration, and user-centered evaluation of existing and new interaction techniques in 2-D, 3-D, and Virtual Reality (VR). The environment's interaction support is based on communicating application objects that employ a sophisticated message-based inter-object communication. In addition, the system contains a component for user-adapted interaction and system support. The system has been used for several clinical applications which are briefly described at the end of this paper.

This methodology is based on the description and comparison of two different models of human tasks: one model - an 'a priori model' - dealing with a probable behaviour and a second - an 'a posteriori model' - dealing with a real observed behaviour. The result constitutes a model explaining an operator's behaviour.
